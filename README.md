My songbook
===========

Songbook sources:

1. [`word/`](word/) -- songs manually edited in MS Word (part1, part2) and generated via HTML (part3, part4)
2. [`latex-chopro/`](latex-chopro/) -- songs converted via chordpro and [GuitarTeX](https://sourceforge.net/projects/guitartex/) (part5)
3. [`latex/`](latex/) -- songs converted to my own LaTeX syntax, with macros at the beginning of the main file (part6)

Original sources for part5 and part6 before conversion are located in [`input-txt/`](input-txt/).
