\begin{song}{Living Next Door to Alice}{Smokie}


\songpart{1.}
\begin{guitar}
^ [A] Sally called and she got the word,\\
^   She said I suppose you've heard,[E]  about [A]Alice.[E]\\
^ When I [A]rushed to the window, and I looked outside\\
^ [D] I could hardly believe my eyes.\\
^ [E] And the big limousine pulled up, in [A]Alice's drive.[E]\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Chorus:}
\begin{guitar}
^ Oh, I [A]don’t know why she's leaving, or where she's gonna go,\\
^ I [D]guess she's got her reasons but I just don’t wanna know.\\
^ 'Cause for [E]twenty-four years I’ve been living next door to [A]Alice[E].\\
^ [A]Twenty-four years just waiting for the chance\\
^ to t[D]ell her how I feel and maybe get a second glance.\\
^ Now I g[E]otta get used to not l[D]iving next door to A[A]lice.\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{2.}
\begin{guitar}
We grew up together, two kids in the park.\\
We inscribed our initials deep in the bark, me and Alice.\\
Now she walks out the door with her head held high,\\
Just for a moment I caught her eye\\
as the big limousine pulls slowly, out of Alice's drive.\\
\end{guitar}


\songpart{Chorus}

\songpart{3.}
\begin{guitar}
And Sally called back and asked how I felt,\\
and she said I know how to help, get over Alice.\\
She said, now Alice is gone, but I’m still here,\\
you know I’ve been waiting for twenty-four years,\\
^ [(N.C.)]and the big limousine disappeared.\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Chorus}

\begin{guitar}
No I never get used to not living next door to Alice.\\
\end{guitar}

\end{song}
