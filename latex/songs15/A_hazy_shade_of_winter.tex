\songpart{1.}
\begin{guitar}
^ [Dm]Time, time, time, see what's be[C]come of me\\
^ While I[Bb] looked around\\
^ For my possi[Am]bilities\\
^ I was so [C]hard to please\\
^ But look a[Dm]round, leaves are [C]brown\\
^ And the [Bb]sky is a [A7]hazy shade of [Dm]winter\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{2.}
\begin{guitar}
Hear the salvation army band\\
Down by the riverside, it's bound to be a better ride\\
Than what you've got planned\\
Carry your cup in your hand\\
And look around, leaves are brown now\\
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{3.}
\begin{guitar}
Hang on to your hopes, my friend\\
That's an easy thing to say, but if your hopes should pass away\\
Simply pretend\\
That you can build them again\\
Look around, the grass is high\\
The fields are ripe, it's the springtime of my life\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Bridge:}
\begin{guitar}
^ [Bb]  Ahhh, seasons change with the [F]scener[Fmaj7]y\\
^ Weaving time in a [C9]tapestry\\
^ Won't you stop and re[Dm]mem-[A7]ber [Dm]me...\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{4.}
\begin{guitar}
... at any convenient time\\
Funny how my memory slips while looking over manuscripts\\
Of unpublished rhyme\\
Drinking my vodka and lime\\
But look around, leaves are brown now\\
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
Outro (fade out):\\
Look around, leaves are brown\\
There's a patch of snow on the ground...\\
\end{guitar}
