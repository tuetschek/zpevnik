\songpart{1.}
\begin{guitar}
^ B[E]illy Ray was a preacher's son\\
^ And when his [A]daddy would visit he'd [E]come along\\
When they'd gather 'round and started talking\\
^ [B7]That's when Billy would take me walking\\
A-through the back yard we'd go walking\\
Then he'd look into my eyes\\
Lord knows to my surprise\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Chorus:}
\begin{guitar}
^ The o[E]nly one who could ever reach me\\
^ [A]  Was the son of a p[E]reacher man\\
^ The o[E]nly boy who could ever teach me\\
^ [A]  Was the son of a pr[E]eacher man\\
^ Yes he was, he[B] was,[A]     mmm, yes he was\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Repeat intro}

\songpart{2.}
\begin{guitar}
Being good isn't always easy\\
No matter how hard I'd try\\
When he started sweet-talkin' to me\\
He'd come and tell me everything is all right\\
He'd kiss and tell me everything is all right\\
Can I get away again tonight\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Chorus}

\songpart{Bridge:}
\begin{guitar}
^ (Yes, he w[D]as) \\
^ How well I remember [A] The look was in his eyes\\
Stealin' kisses from me on the sly\\
^ [B7]   Takin' time to make time\\
Tellin' me that he's all mine\\
^ [E7]  Learnin' from each other's knowin'\\
Look at us here, how much we've grown\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Chorus:}
\begin{guitar}
^ And the o[A]nly one who could ever reach me\\
^ [D]  Was the son of a pr[A]eacher man\\
^ The o[A]nly boy who could ever teach me\\
^ [D]  Was the son of a pr[A]eacher man\\
^ Yes he was, he w[E]as, [D7]ooh yes he was\\
\end{guitar}

The only one who could ever reach me\\
He was the sweet-talking... / Was the son of a preacher man,\\
A kiss-stealin'... / Was the son of a preacher man...\\
