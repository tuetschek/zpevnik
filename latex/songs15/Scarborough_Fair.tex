^ [Dm]Are you going to [Am]Scarborough [Dm]fair\\

^ [Dm]Remember [Am]me to [Dm]one who lives [C]there\\

\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
Tell her to make me a cambric shirt\\
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme\\
Without any seems nor needle work\\
Then she'll be a true love of mine\\
\end{guitar}


\begin{guitar}
Tell her to find me an acre of land\\
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme\\
Between the salt water and the sea strands\\
Then she'll be a true love of mine\\
\end{guitar}


\begin{guitar}
Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather\\
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme\\
And bind it all in a bunch of heather\\
Then she'll be a true love of mine\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
Are you going to Scarborough fair\\
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme\\
Remember me to one who lives there\\
She once was a true love of mine\\
\end{guitar}
