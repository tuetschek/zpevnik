\begin{song}{If It Hadn't Been For Love}{Adele}

\begin{guitar}
^ [Bm]I never would have hitchhiked to Birmingham\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
If it hadn't been for love\\
^ [Bm]I never would have caught the train to Louisiana\\
^ If it [G]hadn't been for love\\
^ [Bm]Never would have run through the blinding rain\\
^ Wi[G]thout one dollar to my name\\
^ [G]If it hadn't been, if it [F#]hadn't been for [Bm (Riff)]love\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
I never would have seen the trouble that I'm in\\
If it hadn't been for love\\
I would have been gone like a wayward wind\\
If it hadn't been for love\\
Nobody knows it better than me\\
I wouldn't be wishing I was free\\
^ If it [G]hadn't been, if it [F#]hadn't been for [Bm (Walk up to D)]love\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Chorus:}
\begin{guitar}
^ [D]Four cold [A]walls a[Em]gainst my [D]will\\
^ At [D]least I [A]know he's [Em]lying [D]still\\
^ [D]Four cold [A]walls with[Em]out pa[D]role\\
^ [D]Lord have m[A]ercy [Em]on my [D]soul\\
\end{guitar}


\begin{guitar}
Never would have gone to that side of town\\
If it hadn't been for love\\
Never would have took a mind to track him down\\
If it hadn't been for love.\\
I never would have loaded up a .44\\
Put myself behind a jail house door\\
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love.\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Chorus}

\begin{guitar}
I never would have hitchhiked to Birmingham\\
If it hadn't been for love\\
I never would have caught the train to Louisiana\\
If it hadn't been for love\\
I never would have loaded up a .44\\
Put myself behind a jail house door\\
|: If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love :|\\
