\begin{guitar}
^ If [Em]God had a [C]name, [G]what would it [D]be?\\
^ And would you [Em]call it to his [C]face, \\
^ [G]if you were [D]faced with him in [Em]all his [C]glory,\\
^ [G]what would you [D]ask, if you had [Em]just one [C]question?[G][D]\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Chorus:}
\begin{guitar}
^ [Cmaj7]Yeah, yeah, [G]God is [D]great \\
^ [Cmaj7]Yeah, yeah, [G]God is [D]good\\
^ [Cmaj7]Yeah, yeah, [D]yeah, yeah, yeah\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
^ What if [Em]God was [C]one of [G]us?[D]\\
^ Just a [Em]slob like [C]one of [G]us?[D]\\
^ Just a [Em]stranger [C]on the [G]bus trying to [D]make his way [Em]home[C][G][D]\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
If God had a face, what would it look like \\
And would you want to see,\\
if seeing meant that you would have to believe, \\
in things like heaven and in Jesus and the saints and all the prophets\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Chorus}

\begin{guitar}
^ Trying to [D]make his way [Em]home.[C]..[G]\\
Like up to heaven all alone...\\
Nobody calling on the phone...\\
'xcept for the Pope, maybe in Rome.\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Solo}

\songpart{Chorus}

\begin{guitar}
Just trying to make his way home...\\
Like a holy rolling stone\\
Back up to heaven all alone\\
Just trying to make his way home...\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
^ Nobody [D]calling on the [Em]phone.[G]..\\
^ 'xcept for the [D]Pope, maybe in [Em]Rome.\\
\end{guitar}
