\begin{guitar}
Saw the ghost of Elvis \\
On Union Avenue\\
Followed him up to the gates of Graceland \\
Then I watched him walk right through \\
Now security they did not see him \\
They just hovered 'round his tomb \\
But there's a pretty little thing, Waiting for the King \\
^ [N.C.]Down in the Jungle Room \\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Chorus:}
\begin{guitar}
When I was walking in Memphis...\\

\begin{guitar}
^ They've got [Csus4]catfish on the [C]table [Csus4][C]\\
^ They've got [Csus4]gospel in the [C]air [Csus4][C]\\
^ And Reverend Green [E7]be glad to [F]see you \\
^ When you [F#dim]haven't got a [G7]prayer [C/G C]\\
^ [N.C.]But boy you've got a prayer in [F]Memphis [G C Am]\\

\begin{guitar}
Now Muriel plays piano \\
Every Friday at the Hollywood \\
And they brought me down to see her \\
And they asked me if I would\\
Do a little number \\
And I sang with all my might\\
And she said, "Tell me are you a Christian child?" \\
And I said "Ma'am I am tonight" \\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Chorus}

\smallskip
\begin{guitar}
Put on my blue suede shoes\\
And I boarded the plane \\
|: Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues \\
In the middle of the pouring rain :|\\
