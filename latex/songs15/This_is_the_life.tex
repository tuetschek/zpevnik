\begin{guitar}
^ [C#m] [A] [E] [G#m]\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{1.}
\begin{guitar}
^ Oh, the [C#m]wind whistles down [A]the cold dark street tonight \\
^ And the [E]people they were dancing [G#m]to the music vibe \\
^ And the [C#m]boys chase the girls with the curls in their hair \\
^ While the [A]shy tormented youth sit way over there \\
^ And the [E]songs they get louder \\
^ Each one better than be[G#m]fore \\
\end{guitar}


\songpart{Chorus:}
\begin{guitar}
^ |: And you're singing the [C#m]songs, thinking this is the life \\
^ And you wake up in the mo[A]rning and your head feels twice the size \\
^ Where you gonna [E]go? Where you gonna go? \\
^ Where you gonna sleep ton[G#m]ight? :|\\
^ Where you gonna sleep to[C#m]night...[A][E][G#m][C#m][A][E][G#m]\\
\end{guitar}


\songpart{2.}
\begin{guitar}
So you're heading down the road in your taxi for four \\
And you're waiting outside Jimmy's front door \\
But nobody's in and nobody's home 'till four \\
So you're sitting there with nothing to do \\
Talking about Robert Riger and his motley crew \\
And where you're gonna go and where you're gonna sleep tonight \\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Chorus 3x}
\end{song}
