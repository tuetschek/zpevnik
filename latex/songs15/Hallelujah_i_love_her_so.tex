\begin{guitar}
When I'm in trouble and I have no friend\\
I know she'll go with me until the end\\
Everybody asks me how I know\\
I smile at them and say, “She told me so”\\
That's why I know, oh, I know\\
Hallelujah, I just love her so\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{3.}
\begin{guitar}
^ [Bb9] Now, if I call her on the [Bdim]telephone\\
^ [F/C] And tell her that I'm [F9+5]all alone\\
^ [Bd9] By the time I count from [Bdim]one to four\\
^ I [G7]hear her ... [A7]on [D7]my [G7]door[C7]\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
In the evening when the sun goes down\\
When there is nobody else around\\
She kisses me and she holds me tight\\
And tells me, “Daddy, everything's all right”\\
That's why I know, yes, I know\\
Hallelujah, I just love her so\\
\end{guitar}
