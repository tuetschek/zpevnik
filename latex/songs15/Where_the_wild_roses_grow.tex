\begin{song}{Where the Wild Roses Grow}{Nick Cave \& Kylie Minogue}

\songpart{Chorus:}
\begin{guitar}
^ They [Gm]call me The Wild [Cm]Ro-[Gm]ose\\
^ But my n[A#]ame was Elisa [D]Day\\
^ Why they c[Gm]all me it I do not k[Cm]no-[Gm]ow\\
^ For my name was [F]Elisa [Gm]Day \\
\end{guitar}


\begin{guitar}
^ (\emph{He:}) From the [Gm]first day I saw her I knew [A#]she was the one\\
^ As she [Cm]stared in my eyes and s[D]miled\\
^ For her [Gm]lips were the color of the [A#]roses\\
^ They [Cm]grew down the river, all [D]bloody and wild \\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
(\emph{Elisa:}) When he knocked on my door and entered the room\\
My trembling subsided in his sure embrace\\
He would be my first man, and with a careful hand\\
He wiped up the tears that ran down my face \\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Chorus}

\begin{guitar}
(\emph{He:}) On the second day I brought her a flower\\
She was more beautiful than any woman I'd seen\\
I said, "Do you know where the wild roses grow\\
So sweet and scarlet and free?" \\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
(\emph{Elisa:}) On the second day he came with a single rose\\
He said: "Give me your loss and your sorrow."\\
I nodded my head, as I lay on the bed\\
"If I show you the roses will you follow?" \\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Chorus}

\begin{guitar}
(\emph{Elisa:}) On the third day he took me to the river\\
He showed me the roses and we kissed\\
And the last thing I heard was a muttered word\\
As he knelt above me with a rock in his fist \\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
(\emph{He:}) On the last day I took her where the wild roses grow\\
And she lay on the bank, the wind light as a thief\\
As I kissed her goodbye, said, "All beauty must die"\\
And I lent down and planted a rose 'tween her teeth \\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Chorus}
