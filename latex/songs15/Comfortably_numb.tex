\begin{song}{Comfortably Numb}{Pink Floyd}

\begin{guitar}
^ Hel[Bm]lo, Is there anybody [A]in there ?\\
^ Just nod if you can [G]hear me[Em]\\
^ Is there [Bm]anyone at home ?\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
Come on now, I hear your feeling down\\
I can ease your pain\\
And get you on your feet again\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
Relax, I'll need some information first\\
Just the basic facts\\
Can you show me where it hurts?\\
\end{guitar}

\medskip
\songpart{Chorus:}
\begin{guitar}
^ [D] There is no pain you are re[A]ceding\\
^ [D] A distant ship smoke on the ho[A]rizon\\
^ [C]You are only coming through in [G]waves\\
^ [C]Your lips move but I can't hear what you're [G]saying\\
^ When [D]I was a child I had a [A]fever\\
^ My [D]hands felt just like two [A]ballons\\
^ [C]Now I've got that feeling once a[G]gain\\
^ I can't explain, you would not [C]understand\\
^ This is not how I [G]am\\
^ [A]I [(Bm)]– – – [C]– have be[G]come comfortably [D]numb.\\

\begin{guitar}
I – – have become comfortably numb.\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
O.K., just a little pinprick\\
There'll be no more – aaaaaaaah!\\
But you may feel a little sick\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
Can you stand up? I do believe it's working, good\\
That'll keep you going through the show\\
Come on, it's time to go.\\
\end{guitar}

\medskip
\songpart{Chorus:}
\begin{guitar}
There is no pain, you are receding\\
A distant ship smoke on the horizon\\
You are only coming through in waves\\
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying\\
When I was a child, I caught a fleeting glimpse\\
Out of the corner of my eye\\
I turned to look but it was gone\\
I cannot put my finger on it now\\
The child is grown, the dream is gone\\
And  I have become comfortably numb.\\
