\begin{song}{Boxer}{Simon and Garfunkel}


\begin{guitar}
^ [C]I am just a poor boy though my story's seldom [Am]told\\
^ I have [G]squandered my resistance\\
^ For a [G7]pocket full of [G6]mumbles, such are [C]promises\\
^ All lies and [Am]jest, still a [G]man hears what he [F]wants to hear\\
^ And disregards the [C]rest[G][G7][G6][C]\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
When I left my home and my family, I was no more than a boy\\
In the company of strangers\\
In the quiet of a railway station, running scared\\
Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters\\
Where the ragged people go\\
Looking for the places only they would know\\
\end{guitar}


\songpart{Chorus:}
\begin{guitar}
^ Lie-la-l[Am]ie, lie-la-[Em]lie la lie-la-lie\\
^ Lie la l[Am]ie, lie-[G]la-lie la la la la l[F]ie la la la [G]la l[C]ie\\
\end{guitar}


\begin{guitar}
Asking only workman's wages I come looking for a job\\
But I get no offers\\
Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue\\
I do declare, there were times when I was so lonesome\\
I took some comfort there, lie lie lie lie la\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Chorus}

\begin{guitar}
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone\\
Going home where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me\\
Leading me, going home.\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade\\
And he carries a reminder of ev'ry glove that laid him down\\
Or cut him till he cried out in his anger and his shame\\
I am leaving, I am leaving\\
But the fighter still remains\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
Chorus (repeat and fade)\\
