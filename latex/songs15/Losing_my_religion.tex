\songpart{1.}
\begin{guitar}
^ [G]  Oh, [Am]life is bigger,[Em]  It's bigger than you\\
^ And you are [Am]not me.\\
^ The lengths that I will [Em]go to, the distance [Am]in your eyes,\\
^ [Em]  Oh no, I've said too [Dm]much, I set it [G]up.\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{2.}
\begin{guitar}
That's me in the corner, that's me in the spotlight\\
Losing my religion.\\
Trying to keep up with you. And I don't know if I can do it.\\
Oh no, I've said too much, I haven't said enough.\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Chorus:}
\begin{guitar}
^ I [G]thought that I heard you [F]laughing,\\
^ I [Dm]thought that I [G]heard you [Am]sing.[Am/B][Am/C][Am/D]\\
^ [Am]I  [F]think I thought I [Dm]saw [G]you [Am]try.\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{3.}
\begin{guitar}
Every whisper of every waking hour,\\
I'm choosing my confessions,\\
Trying to keep an eye of you like a hurt lost and blinded fool, fool\\
Oh no, I've said too much, I set it up.\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
Consider this, consider this â€“ the hint of a century,\\
Consider this: the slip\\
That brought me to my knees failed. What if all these fantasies\\
Come flailing around now I've said too much?\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Chorus}

\songpart{Bridge:}
\begin{guitar}
^ [Am]   [G] C[F]  [G]             D\\
But that was just a dream,\\
^ [C]That was just a [D]dream.\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{4. = 2.}

\songpart{Chorus}

\begin{guitar}
^ But [F]that was just a [Dm]dream[G],\\
^ [Am]Try, [Am/B]cry,   [Am/C]why,   [Am/D]try.[Am]\\
^ [F]That was just a dream, [Dm]   [G]just a [Am]dream, just a [G]dream, dream.[Am]\\
\end{guitar}
