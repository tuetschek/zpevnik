\songpart{1.}
\begin{guitar}
^ [Em] She was [F#m/E]more like a be[G/D]auty queen, from a [F#m/E]movie scene,\\
^ [Em] I said; [F#m/E]don't mind, but what do[G/D] you mean; [F#m/E]I am the [Am7]one?\\
^ Who will dance on the floor, in the [Em]round.[F#m/E][G/D]\\

\end{guitar}

\songpart{2.}
\begin{guitar}
She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene.\\
Then every head turned, with eyes that dreamed of being the one,\\
Who will dance on the floor, in the round.\\
\end{guitar}


\songpart{Bridge:}
\begin{guitar}
^ [C] People always told me; be [Em]careful what you do;\\
^ And don't [C]go around breaking young girl's [Em]hearts.\\
^ And [C]mother always told me; be [Em]careful of who you love;\\
^ And be [C]careful of what you do, 'cos the [B7]lie becomes the truth.\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Chorus:}
\begin{guitar}
^ [Em] Billie [F#m/E]Jean is [G/D]not my [F#m/E]lover;\\
^ [Em] She's just a [F#m/E]girl who, [G/D]claims that [F#m/E]I am the [Am7]one.\\
^ But the kid is not my [Em]son.[F#m/E][G/D]\\
^ She says; [F#m/E]I am the [Am7]one, but the kid is not my [Em]son[F#m/E].[G/D][F#m/E]\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{3.}
\begin{guitar}
For forty days and forty nights, the law was on her side.\\
But who can stand, when she's in demand, her schemes and plans?\\
'Cos we danced on the floor, in the round.\\
So take my strong a-dvice; just remember to always think twice.\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{4.}
\begin{guitar}
She told my baby we'd danced 'till three, then she looked a me,\\
Then showed a photo; my baby cried; his eyes looked like mine.\\
Go on dance on the floor, in the round, baby.\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Bridge:}
\begin{guitar}
People always told me; be careful what you do;\\
And don't go around breaking young girl's hearts.\\
She came and stood right by me; then the smell of sweet perfume.\\
This happened much too soon; she called me to her room.\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Chorus 2x}
