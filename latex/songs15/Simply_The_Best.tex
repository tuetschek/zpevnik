\begin{song}{Simply the Best}{Tina Turner}

\begin{guitar}
^ I [F]call you when I need you, my heart's on fire \\
^ You [F]come to me, come to me wild and wired \\
^ When you come to [Dm]me \\
^ Give me everything I[Bb] need[Bb] \\
^ Give me a [F]lifetime of promises and a world of dreams \\
Speak the language of love like you know what it means \\
ohh, it can't be wrong \\
Take my heart and make it stronger baby \\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Chorus:}
\begin{guitar}
^ [C] You're simply the [F]best, better than all the rest \\
^ Better than [Dm]anyone, anyone I've [C7]ever met \\
^ I'm stuck on your [F]heart, I hang on every word you say \\
^ Tear us a[Dm]part, baby I would [C7]rather be dead \\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
In your heart I see the stars of every night and every day \\
In your eyes I get lost, I get washed away \\
Just as long as I'm here in your arms \\
I could be in no better place \\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Chorus}

\songpart{Bridge:}
\begin{guitar}
^ [Bb] Each time you leave me I start losing control \\
^ You're [Dm]walking away with my heart and my soul \\
^ [Bb] I can feel you even when I'm alone \\
^ [C] Oh baby, don't let [D]go[G][Em][D7]\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Chorus:}
\begin{guitar}
^ You're the [G]best, better than all the rest \\
^ Better than [Em]anyone, anyone I've [D7]ever met \\
^ I'm stuck on your [G]heart, and hang on every word you say \\
^ Tear us a[Em]part, baby I would [D7]rather be dead\\
^ Oh, You're the best[G]...\\
\end{guitar}
