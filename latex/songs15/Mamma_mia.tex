\songpart{1.}
\begin{guitar}
^ [D]I've been cheated by you since I don't know[G] when\\
^ [D]So I made up my mind, it must [G]come to an end\\
^ [D]Look at me now, will I ever learn?\\
^ [D]I don't know how but I suddenly [G]lose control\\
^ [G]There's a fire wi[A]thin my soul\\
^ [G]Just [D]one [A]look and I can hear a bell ring\\
^ [G]One [D]more [A]look and I forget everything, o-o-o-oh\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Chorus:}
\begin{guitar}
^ [D]Mamma mia, here I go again\\
^ [G]My my, how can I resist you?\\
^ [D]Mamma mia, does it show again?\\
^ [G]My my, just how much I've missed you\\
^ [D]Yes, I've been brokenhearted\\
^ [A]Blue since the day we parted\\
^ [G]Why, why did I ever let you go?\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
^ [D]Mamma mia, now I really know,\\
^ [G]My my, I could never let you go.\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{2.}
\begin{guitar}
I've been angry and sad about the things that you do\\
I can't count all the times that I've told you were through\\
And when you go, when you slam the door\\
I think you know that you won't be away too long\\
You know that I'm not that strong.\\
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring\\
One more look and I forget everything, o-o-o-oh\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Chorus}
\begin{guitar}
Mamma mia, here I go again...\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
Mamma mia, even if I say\\
Bye bye, leave me now or never\\
Mamma mia, its a game we play\\
Bye bye doesnt mean forever\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
Mamma mia, here I go again...\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
Mamma mia, now I really know\\
My my, I could never let you go.\\
\end{guitar}
\end{song}
