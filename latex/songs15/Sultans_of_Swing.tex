\begin{guitar}
^ You get a s[Dm]hiver in the dark,\\
^ it's [C]raining in the [Bb]park but [A]meantime.\\
^ [Dm]South of the river you [C]stop and you [Bb]hold every[A]thing.\\
^ [F] A band is blowing Dixie double [C]four time,\\
^ [Bb] you feel alright when you hear that music [Dm]ring[Bb][C]\\
\end{guitar}


\begin{guitar}
Now, you step inside but you don't see too many faces\\
coming in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down.\\
Competition in other places,\\
but the horns, they're blowing that sound.\\
^ Way on down south[Bb], [C]way on down south [Dm]London town.\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{2.}
\begin{guitar}
Check out Guitar George, he knows all the chords.\\
Mind he's strictly rhythm, he doesn't want to make it cry or sing.\\
They say an old guitar is all he can afford\\
when he gets up under the lights to play his thing.\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene,\\
he's got a daytime job he's doing allright.\\
He can play the honky tonk like anything,\\
saving it up for Friday night\\
with the Sultans, with the Sultans of Swing.\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{3.}
\begin{guitar}
And a crowd of young boys, they're fooling around in the corner,\\
drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles.\\
They don't give a damn about any trumpet playing band,\\
it ain't what they call rock and roll.\\
Then the sultans, yeah the sultans play Creole.\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{4.}
\begin{guitar}
Then the man, he steps right up to the microphone,\\
and says at last just as the time bell rings:\\
“Goodnight, now it's time to go home.”\\
And he makes it fast with one more thing.\\
We are the Sultans, we are the Sultans of Swing\\
\end{guitar}
