\songpart{Verse:}
\begin{guitar}
^ As I [Cm]walk through the valley of the [G#]shadow of death\\
^ I take a [G]look at my life and rea[Cm]lize there's nothin' left\\
\end{guitar}
\begin{guitar}
Cause I've been blasting and laughing so long,\\
That even mama thinks that my mind is gone\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it\\
Me be treated like a punk, you know it's unheard of\\
You better watch how you're talking, where you're walking\\
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
I really hate to trip but I gotta loc\\
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke, fool\\
I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like\\
On my knees in the night saying prayers in the streetlight\\

\songpart{Verse:}
\begin{guitar}
(Look) at the situation they got me facin'\\
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the streets\\
So I gotta be down with the hood team\\
Too much television watching got me chasing dreams\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
I'm an educated fool with money on my mind\\
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye\\
I'm a loc'd out gangsta set trippin' banger\\
And my homies is down so don't arouse my anger, fool\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
Death ain't nothing but a heartbeat away,\\
I'm living life, do or die, what can I say\\
I'm twenty-three now, will I live to see twenty-four\\
The way things are going, I don't know\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Bridge 2x}

\begin{guitar}
Power and the money, money and the power\\
Minute after minute, hour after hour\\
Everybody's running, but half of them ain't looking\\
What's going on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me\\
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me\\
I guess they can't, I guess they won't\\
I guess they front, that's why I know my life is out of luck, fool\\
\end{guitar}
