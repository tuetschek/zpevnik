\songpart{1.}
\begin{guitar}
^ It was [G]on a summer's [Em]night, I [C]got an offie [D]fright\\
^ [G]When I went for a [Em]swim in Loch [C]Lo-[D]mond,\\
Because when I cam oot, my clothes were nae aboot\\
For some passerby had pinched them in the gloamin'.\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
^ And [G]I couldnae tak' the [Em]high road, I [C]couldnae tak the [D]low road\\
^ As [G]round and round I [Em]stumbled in the [C]gloa[D]min'\\
I was sich an offie sight when it came on braid daylight\\
I was carried hame in a blankie fae Loch Lomond.\\
\end{guitar}


\songpart{2.}
\begin{guitar}
And another fright I got when I went oot in a boat\\
On a fishin' expedition in Loch Lomond\\
For I hooked an offie weight, and I'm tellin' ye noo straight\\
It took me from that night until next mornin'.\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
For it wouldnae tak the high road, it wouldnae tak the low road\\
That beast weighed o'er a ton and I was foamin'\\
What do ye think I seen, shinin' through two eyes o' green?\\
It was the Loch Ness monster in Loch Lomond!\\
\end{guitar}


\songpart{3.}
\begin{guitar}
So I went upon a spree at a local jubilee\\
In a house on the banks of Loch Lomond\\
But I practically got hung when they heered the sang I sung\\
And threw me oot on the banks o' Loch Lomond\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
For I couldnae hit the high notes, I couldnae hit the low notes\\
The master o' the house, he was foamin'\\
And I clean forgot the air, when he hit me wi' a chair\\
And flung me oot on the banks o' Loch Lomond.\\
\end{guitar}


\songpart{4.}
\begin{guitar}
So, I had a drink or twa before I gae'd awa\\
In a hotel on the banks o' Loch Lomond\\
I was clean enjoyin' masel' when they rang the closin' bell\\
And flung me oot on the banks o' Loch Lomond\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
For I couldnae see the high road, I couldnae see the low road\\
As round and round I stumbled in the gloamin'\\
Next mornin' sich a druith, noo I'm tellin' ye the truth,\\
I drank a puir o' water fae Loch Lomond.\\
\end{guitar}
\end{song}
