\begin{song}{Take Me To Church}{Hozier}

\begin{guitar}
^ [Em]  My lover's got [Am]humour\\
^ [Em]  She's the giggle at a [Am]funeral\\
^ [G]  Knows everybody's disap[Am]proval\\
^ [Em]  I should've worshipped her [Am]sooner\\
^ [Em]  If the Heavens ever [Am]did speak\\
^ [Em]  She is the last true [Am]mouthpiece\\
^ [G]  Every Sunday's getting [Am]more bleak\\
^ [Em]  A fresh poison [Am]each week\\
^ [D] 'We were born sick, [C] you heard them say it\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
My church offers no absolutes\\
She tells me 'worship in the bedroom'\\
The only heaven I'll be sent to\\
Is when I'm alone with you\\
I was born sick, but I love it\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
^ [C]Command me to be well\\
^ Aa[G]aa [C]a-[G]men. [Cm]Aaa-[G]men. [Cm]Aa-[G]men. [G]  [F#]\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Chorus (2x):}
\begin{guitar}
^ [F#] Take [F]me to [Em]church\\
^ I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your l[B7]ies\\
^ I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your k[G]nife\\
^ Offer me that dea[Am]thless death\\
^ Good [Em]God, let me give you my [Am]lif[G]e\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Verse 2:}
\begin{guitar}
If I'm a pagan of the good times\\
My lover's the sunlight\\
To keep the Goddess on my side\\
She demands a sacrifice\\
To drain the whole sea, get something shiny\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
Something meaty for the main course\\
That's a fine looking high horse\\
What you got in the stable?\\
We've a lot of starving faithful\\
That looks tasty, That looks plenty\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
^ [C]This is hungry work[G][F#]\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Chorus 2x}

\songpart{Bridge:}
\begin{guitar}
^ [C]  No masters or [G]kings when the [B7]ritual be[Em]gins\\
^ There is [C]no sweeter [G]innocence than [B7]our gentle [Em]sin\\
^ In the [C]madness and [G]soil of that [B7]sad earthly [Em]scene\\
^ Only [C]then I am [G]human, only [B7]then I am [Em]clean[D][C]\\
^ Aa[G]aa [C]a-[G]men. [Cm]Aaa-[G]men. [Cm]Aa-[G]men. [G]  [F#]\\
\end{guitar}
