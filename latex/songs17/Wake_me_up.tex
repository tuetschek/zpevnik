\songpart{Intro:}
\begin{guitar}
|: \textbf{C#m  A   E   B} :|\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Verse 1:}
\begin{guitar}
^ [C#m]Feeling my w[A]ay through the [E]darknes[E]s\\
Guided by a beating heart\\
I can’t tell where the journey will end\\
But I know where it starts\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
They tell me I’m too young to understand\\
They say I’m caught up in a dream\\
Well life will pass me by if I don’t open up my eyes\\
Well that’s fine by me\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Chorus:}
\begin{guitar}
^ |: So wake me [C#m]up when [A]it’s all [E]over[B]\\
When I’m wiser and I’m older\\
All this time I was finding myself\\
And I didn’t know I was lost :|\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Verse 2:}
\begin{guitar}
I tried carrying the weight of the world\\
But I only have two hands\\
Hope I get the chance to travel the world\\
And I don’t have any plans\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
Wish that I could stay forever this young\\
Not afraid to close my eyes\\
Life’s a game made for everyone\\
And love is a prize\\
\end{guitar}


\songpart{Chorus}

\songpart{Outro:}
\begin{guitar}
^ And I, |: I [C#m]didn’t know [A]I was [E]lost  [B] :|\\
\end{guitar}

\end{song}
