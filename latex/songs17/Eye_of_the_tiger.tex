\songpart{Verse 1:}
\begin{guitar}
^ [Am]   Risin' up, ba[F]ck on the street,\\

^ [Am]  Went the distance, now I'm ba[F]ck on my feet,\\

\begin{guitar}
So many times, it happens too fast,\\
You change your passion for glory\\
Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past,\\
You must fight just to keep them alive:\\

\begin{guitar}
^ [G] It's [Am]the [Dm]  eye of the tiger, it's the [C]thrill of the [G]fight -\\
^ Rising [Dm]up to the challenge of our [Am]ri - [G]val.\\
^ And the[Dm] last known survivor stalks his [C]prey in the [G]night,\\
         Dm          Em7          F  N.C.    Am\\
And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger.\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Verse 2:}
\begin{guitar}
Face to face, out in the heat,\\
Hangin' tough, stayin' hungry.\\
They stack the odds, still we take to the street,\\
For we kill with the skill to survive.\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Chorus}

\songpart{Verse 3:}
\begin{guitar}
Risin' up, straight to the top,\\
Had the guts, got the glory.\\
Went the distance, now I'm not gonna stop,\\
Just a man and his will to survive.\\
\end{guitar}
