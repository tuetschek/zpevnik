^ Ooh, I [Dm]bet you're wonderin' [G/D]how I [Dm]knew,\\
^ 'Bout your [A7]plans to make me [G7]blue.\\
^ With some other [Dm]guy you [G/D]knew be-[Dm]fore,\\
^ Between two of us [A7]guys, you know I loved you [G7]more.\\
^ It took me by sur-[Bm]prise, I must [G7]say,\\

^ I [Dm]heard it through the [G/D]grape-[Dm]vine;\\
^ Not much [G7]longer, would you be mine.\\

\songpart{Verse 2:}
\begin{guitar}
I know a man ain't sup-posed to cry,\\
But these tears, I can't hold in-side.\\
Losing you, would end my life, you see,\\
'Cos you mean that much to me.\\
You could have told me your-self,\\
That you loved someone else. Instead...\\

\songpart{Verse 3:}
\begin{guitar}
People say; believe half of what you see,\\
Son, and none of what you hear.\\
But I can't help, but be confused,\\
If it's true, please tell me, dear.\\
Do you plan to let me go,\\
For the other guy you loved be-fore?\\
