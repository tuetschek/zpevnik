\begin{song}{Penny Lane}{The Beatles}

\songpart{1. }
\begin{guitar}
^ In Penny [A]Lane there is a [F#m]barber showing [Bm]photograph[E7]s\\
^ Of every [A]head he's had the [F#m]pleasure to [Am]know\\
^And all the [F#dim7]people that come and [Fmaj7]go stop and [E7]say hello\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{2. }
\begin{guitar}
On the corner is a banker with a motor car\\
The little children laugh at him behind his back\\
And the banker never wears a mac in the pouring rain, \\
^ [D]very strange\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Chorus: }
\begin{guitar}
^ Penny [G]Lane is in my [Bm]ears and in my [C]eyes\\
^ [G]There beneath the [Bm]blue suburban [C]skies I sit and [E7]meanwhile back\\
\end{guitar}


\songpart{3. }
\begin{guitar}
In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hour glass  \\
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen\\
He likes to keep his fire engine clean, it's a clean machine\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Solo on verse}

\songpart{Chorus:}
\begin{guitar}
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes\\
A four of fish and finger pies in summer meanwhile back\\
\end{guitar}


\songpart{4. }
\begin{guitar}
Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout\\
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray\\
And though she feels as if she's in a play   she is anyway\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{5. }
\begin{guitar}
In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer\\
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim\\
And then the fireman rushes in from the pouring rain   very strange\\
\end{guitar}


\songpart{Chorus:}
\begin{guitar}
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes\\
There beneath the blue suburban skies I sit and meanwhile back\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
^ Penny L[A]ane is in my [C#m7]ears and in my [D]eyes\\
^ [A]There beneath the [C#m7]blue suburban [D]skies... Penny [A]Lane\\
\end{guitar}
\end{song}
