\begin{guitar}
|: \textbf{C D G Em} :|\\
\end{guitar}


\songpart{Verse 1:}
\begin{guitar}
^ [Em]  I used to [C]rule the [D]world \\
^ Seas would [G]rise when I gave the [Em]word \\
^ Now in the morning I [C]sleep al[D]one \\
^ Sweep the [G]streets I used to [Em]own\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Repeat intro }

\songpart{Verse 2:}
\begin{guitar}
I used to roll the dice \\
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes \\
Listen as the crowd would sing: \\
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
One minute I held the key \\
Next the walls were closed on me \\
And I discovered that my castles stand \\
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand \\
\end{guitar}


\songpart{Chorus:}
\begin{guitar}
^ I [C]hear Jerusalem [D]bells are ringing \\
^ [G]Roman Cavalry [Em]choirs are singing \\
^ [C]Be my mirror, my [D]sword, and shield \\
^ My [G]missionaries in a [Em]foreign field \\
^ [C]For some reason I [D]can't explain \\
^ [G]Once you go there was [Em]never, never an [C]honest [D]word\\
^ That was [Bm]when I ruled the [Em]world \\
\end{guitar}


\songpart{Repeat intro }

\songpart{Verse 3:}
\begin{guitar}
It was the wicked and wild wind \\
Blew down the doors to let me in. \\
Shattered windows and the sound of drums \\
People couldn't believe what I'd become\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
Revolutionaries wait \\
For my head on a silver plate \\
Just a puppet on a lonely string\\
Oh who would ever want to be king? \\
\end{guitar}
