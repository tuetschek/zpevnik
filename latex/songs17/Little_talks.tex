\songpart{Intro:}
\begin{guitar}
|: \textbf{ Am   Fmaj7   C   G} :| 4x\\
\end{guitar}


\begin{guitar}
^ [Am]Don't listen to a [Fmaj7]word I [C]say\\
^ [Am]The screams all [Fmaj7]sound the [C]same\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Verse 1:}
\begin{guitar}
^ [Am]I don't like [Fmaj7]walking around this [C]old and empty house\\
^ So [Am]hold my hand, I'll [F]walk with you my [C]dear\\
^ The [Am]stairs creak [Fmaj7]as I sleep, it's [C]keeping me awake\\
^ It's the [Am]house telling [F]you to close your [C]eyes\\
^ [Am]Some days [Fmaj7]I can't even  [C]trust myself\\
^ It's [Am]killing me to [F]see you this [C]way\\
\end{guitar}


\songpart{Chorus 1:}
\begin{guitar}
^ 'Cause though the [Am]truth may [Fmaj7]vary\\
^ This [C]ship will [G]carry our [Am]bodies [Fmaj7]safe to [C]shore \\
|: \textbf{ Am   Fmaj7   C   G} :| 4x\\
\end{guitar}


\songpart{Verse 2:}
\begin{guitar}
There's an old voice in my head that's holding me back\\
Well tell her that I miss our little talks\\
Soon it will be over and buried with our past\\
We used to play outside when we were young (and full of life and full of love)\\
Some days I don't know if I am wrong or right\\
Your mind is playing tricks on you my dear\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Chorus 2}
\begin{guitar}
^ 'Cause though the [Am]truth may [Fmaj7]vary\\
^ This [C]ship will [G]carry our [Am]bodies [Fmaj7]safe to [C]shore \\
^ [Am]Don't listen to a [Fmaj7]word I [C]say[G]\\
^ [Am]The screams all [Fmaj7]sound the s[C]ame[G]\\
^ And though the [Am]truth may [Fmaj7]vary\\
^ This [C]ship will [G]carry our [Am]bodies [Fmaj7]safe to [C]shore [G]\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Solo on Chorus 2}

\songpart{Verse 3:}
\begin{guitar}
You're gone, gone, gone away. I watched you disappear\\
All that's left is a ghost of you\\
Now we're torn, torn, torn apart, there's nothing we can do. \\
Just let me go, we'll meet again soon.\\
Now wait, wait, wait for me. Please hang around\\
I'll see you when I fall asleep.\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Chorus 3 (2x):}
\begin{guitar}
Don't listen to a word I say\\
The screams all sound the same\\
And though the truth may vary\\
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore \\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Outro:}
\begin{guitar}
|: Though the truth may vary\\
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore :|\\
\end{guitar}
