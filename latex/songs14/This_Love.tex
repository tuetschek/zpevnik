\songpart{1.}
\begin{guitar}
^ [G]I was so high I did not [Cm]recognize\\
^ The fire burning [Fm]in her eyes\\
^ The chaos that [G7]controlled my mind\\
^ [G]whispered goodbye as she got [Cm]on a plane\\
^ Never to re[Fm]turn again\\
^ But always in my [G7]heart\\
\end{guitar}


\songpart{Chorus:}
\begin{guitar}
^ T[Cm]his [Fm]love has [Bb]taken its [Eb]toll on me\\
^ S[Cm]he said Good[Fm]bye too [Bb]many times be[Eb]fore\\
^ And [Cm]her [Fm]heart is [Bb]breaking in [Eb]front of me\\
^ I[Cm] have no [Fm]choice cause [Bb]I won't say good[Ab]bye any[G]more\\

\songpart{2.}\\
\begin{guitar}
I tried my best to feed her appetite\\
Keep her coming every night\\
So hard to keep her satisfied\\
Kept playing love like it was just a game\\
Pretending to feel the same\\
Then turn around and leave again  (oh!)\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Chorus}

\songpart{Bridge}
\begin{guitar}
^ [Fm]I'll fix these broken things\\
^ [Ebmaj7]Repair your broken wings\\
^ [G7]And make sure everything's a[Cm]lright (it's alright)\\
^ [Fm]My pressure on her hips\\
^ [Ebmaj7]Sinking my fingertips\\
^ [G]Into every inch of you\\
^ [G7]Cause I know that's what you want me to do\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Chorus 3x}
