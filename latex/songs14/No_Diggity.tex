\songpart{2.}
\begin{guitar}
She's got class and style\\
And balance by the pound,\\
Shorty never act wild\\
Very low key on the profile\\
Catching villains is a no,\\
Let me tell you how it goes\\
Curves the words, spins the verbs\\
Lovers it curves so freak what you heard\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
Rollin' with the phatness\\
You never quite know what the half is\\
You got to pay to play\\
Just for shorty, bang-bang, to look your way\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
I like the way you work it\\
Tough notch, Trumped tight, every day,\\
You're blowing my mind, baby, in time\\
maybe I can get you in my ride\\
\end{guitar}

Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo\\
Damn that girl looks good\\
^ [F#m]Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey y[E]o no [D]no \\
