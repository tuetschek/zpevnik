\begin{guitar}
^ [D]  [E]I must have dreamed a thousand dreams,\\
^ [G]  [A]been hunted by a million screams.\\
^ [A]  [G]I can hear the marching feet,\\
^ [D]  [E]they're moving into the street.\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{2.}
\begin{guitar}
Now did you read the news today ?\\
They say the danger's gone away.\\
But I can see the fire's still alight\\
burning into the night.\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Chorus:}
\begin{guitar}
^ [D]There's too many [E]men, [G]too many [A]people\\
^ making [D]too many [E]problems,\\
^ and [D]not much [E]love to go around.\\
^ [A]Can't you see, this is a [G]land of conf[E]usion ?\\
^ [E]So [C]this is the [D]world we [Bm]live in,[E]\\
^ [C]and these are the [D]hands we're [Bm]given.[E]\\
^ [C]Use them and [D]let's start [Bm]trying[E]\\
^ [C]to make it a [D]place worth [Bm]living [A]in.\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
Oh superman, where are you now,\\
when everything's gone wrong somehow ?\\
The man of steel, men of power\\
are losing control by the hour.\\
\end{guitar}


\songpart{Chorus:}
\begin{guitar}
This is the time, this is the place.\\
So we look for the future.\\
But there's not much love to go around...\\

^ [C#m -] [F#/C# -] [A/C# -] [C#m] [F#/C#]\\

^ I remember [C#m]long ago, when the [F#/C#]sun was shining,\\
^ the [A/C#]stars were bright all through the night,\\
^ and the [C#m]sound of your laughter\\
^ as I held you [A/C#]tight, so long [C]ago.[D][C][D][C][D][C][D]\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{4.}
\begin{guitar}
I won't be coming home tonight.\\
My generation will put it right.\\
We're not just making promises\\
that we know we'll never keep.\\
\end{guitar}


\songpart{Chorus:}
\begin{guitar}
Too many men, too many people...\\
\end{guitar}

\newpage
\begin{guitar}
This is a world we live in\\
and these are the names we're given.\\
Stand up and let's start showing\\
^ [C]just where our [D]lives are [Bm]going [E]to[D][E]\\
\end{guitar}
