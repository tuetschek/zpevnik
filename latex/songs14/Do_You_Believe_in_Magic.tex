\begin{song}{Do You Believe in Magic}{The Lovin' Spoonful}

\begin{guitar}
^ [Dm] [Em] [F] [Em] [Dm] [Em] [F] [G]\\

^ [G]Do you believe in [C]magic in a [F]young girl's heart\\
^ How the [C]music can free her, when[F]ever it starts\\
^ And it's [C]magic, if the [F]music is groovy\\
^ It [C]makes you feel happy like an [F]old-time movie\\
^ I'll [Dm]tell you about the [Em]magic, and it'll [F]free your [Em]soul\\
^ But it's like [G]trying to tell a stranger 'bout rock and roll\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
If you believe in magic don't bother to choose\\
If it's jug band music or rhythm and blues\\
Just go and listen it'll start with a smile\\
It won't wipe off your face no matter how hard you try\\
Your feet start tapping and you can't seem to find\\
How you got there, so just blow your mind\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
If you believe in magic, come along with me\\
We'll dance until morning 'til there's just you and me\\
And maybe, if the music is right\\
I'll meet you tomorrow, sort of late at night\\
And we'll go dancing, baby, then you'll see\\
How the magic's in the music and the music's in me\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
^ Yeah, do you believe in [C]magic\\
^ Yeah, [F]believe in the [Em]magic of a [F]young girl's [Em]soul\\
^ Be[F]lieve in the [Em]magic of [F]rock and [Em]roll\\
^ Be[F]lieve in the [Em]magic that can [F]set you [Em]free\\
^ Ohh, talking 'bout [F]magic\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
^ /: Do [C]you be[Dm]lieve like [Em]I  be[Dm]lieve :/\\
\end{guitar}
