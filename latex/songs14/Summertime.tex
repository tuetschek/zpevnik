\begin{song}{Summertime}{George Gershwin}

\begin{guitar}
^ Summer[F#m7]time,[G#m7b5] and the [C#7]living is [F#m7]easy,[F#7] \\
^ Fish are [Bm]jumping and the cotton is [G#m7b5]high. [C#7]\\
^ Your daddy is [F#m7]rich [Gm7b5] and your [C#7]mummy's good [F#m]lookin',[Bm] \\
^ [E7]So [Amaj7]hush, little baby,[G#m7b5] don't [C#7]you [F#m7]cry. [G#m7b5][C#7]\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
One of these mornings you'll gonna rise up singin', \\
Then you'll spread your wings and you'll take the sky.\\
But till that morning there's nothing can harm you, \\
With daddy and mammy, mammy standing by. \\
\end{guitar}
