\begin{song}{Leaving on a Jet Plane}{John Denver}

\songpart{1.}
\begin{guitar}
^ All my [G]bags are packed, I'm r[C]eady to go,\\
^ I'm s[G]tanding here outs[C]ide your door,\\
^ I h[G]ate to wake you [C]up to say good[D]bye.\\
But the dawn is breaking, it's early morn,\\
The taxi's waitin', he's blowing his horn,\\
Already I'm so lonesome I could cry.\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{R:}
\begin{guitar}
^ So k[G]iss me and s[C]mile for me,\\
^ [G]Tell me that you'll [C]wait for me, \\
^ [G]Hold me like you'll [C]never let me [D]go.\\
^ 'Cause I'm l[G]eaving [C]on a jet plane, \\
^ [G]Don't know when [C]I'll be back again,\\
^ [G]Oh, b[C]abe, I hate to[D] go.\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{2.}
\begin{guitar}
There's so many times I've let you down,\\
So many times I played around,\\
I tell you they don't mean a thing.\\
Every place I go I'll think of you,\\
Every song I sing I'll sing for you, \\
When I come back I'll bring your wedding ring.\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{R:}

\songpart{3.}
\begin{guitar}
Now the time has come to leave you,\\
One more time let me kiss you,\\
Then close your eyes, I'll be on my way.\\
Dream about the days to come,\\
When I won't have to leave alone,\\
About the times I won't have to say:\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{R: }

\songpart{Outro:}
\begin{guitar}
^ I'm l[G]eaving [C]on a jet plane,\\
^ [G]Don't know when I[C]'ll be back again,\\
^ [G]Oh, b[C]abe, I hate to [D]go.[G]\\
\end{guitar}
