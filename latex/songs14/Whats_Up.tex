^ [A]Twenty-five years and my life is still,\\
^ [Bm]trying to get up that great big hill of [D]hope\\

\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
I realized quickly when I knew I should\\
that the whole world's made up of this brotherhood of men,\\
for whatever that means.\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Pre-Chorus:}
\begin{guitar}
And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed\\
just to get it all out, what's in my head,\\
and I, I am feelin' a little peculiar.\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
And so I wake in the mornin' and I step outside,\\
and I take a deep breath and I get real high,\\
and I scream from the top of my lungs:\\
^ [A]What's goin' on?\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Chorus: (2x)}
\begin{guitar}
^ And I say [A]hey-ey-ey-ey-eh [Bm]hey-ey-eh\\
^ I said [D]hey, what's goin' [A]on?\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
Ooh, Ooh, Oooohh, Oooohh...\\
Ooh, Ooh, Oooohh, Oooohh...\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
And I try, oh my God, do I try,\\
I try all the time in this institution.\\
And I pray, oh my God, do I pray,\\
I pray ev'ry single day for a revolution.\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Pre-Chorus}
\songpart{Chorus 2x}

\begin{guitar}
Ooh, Ooh, Oooohh, Oooohh...\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
Twenty-five years and my life is still,\\
trying to get up that great big hill of hope\\
for a destination.\\
\end{guitar}
