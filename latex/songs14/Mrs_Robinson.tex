\begin{guitar}
Hide it in a hiding place where no one ever goes\\
Put it in your pantry with your cupcakes\\
It's a little secret just the Robinsons' afair\\
Most of all you've got to hide it from the kids\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
Koo koo ka choo Mrs. Robinson...\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
Sitting on a sofa on a Sunday afternoon\\
Going to the candidates debate\\
Laugh about it shout about it when you've got to choose\\
Any way you look at it you lose\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
Where have you gone Joe DiMaggio\\
A nation turns its lonely eyes to you, woo woo woo\\
What's that you say Mrs. Robinson\\
Joltin' Joe has left and gone away, hey hey hey, hey hey hey\\
\end{guitar}
