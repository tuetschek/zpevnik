\begin{song}{Angels}{Robbie Williams}

\songpart{1.}
\begin{guitar}
^ [E]  I sit and [E]wait. Does an angel contem[A]plate my fate?[C#m]\\
^ [B]And do they k[E]now the places where we go when we're grey and [A]old?[C#m]\\
^ [B]'Cause I have been [A]told that salvation lets their [C#m]wings unfold.[A]\\
^ So when I'm [D]lying in my bed, thoughts [A]running through my head,\\
^ And I [E]feel that love is dead.[D] I'm loving [A]angels in[E]stead.\\
\end{guitar}

\newpage
\songpart{Chorus:}
\begin{guitar}
^ And through it [B]all she offers me pro[C#m]tection, \\
^ A lot love and a[A]ffection, whether I'm right or [E]wrong.\\
^ And down the water[B]fall wherever it may [C#m]take me,\\
^ I know that life won't [A]break me.\\
^ When I come to [G#m]call, she won't for[F#m]sake me.\\
^ [D] I'm loving [A]angels in[E]stead.\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{2.}
\begin{guitar}
When I'm feeling weak and my pain walks down a one way street.\\
I look above and I know I'll always be blessed with love.\\
And as the feeling grows, she breathes flesh to my bones\\
And when love is dead, I'm loving angels instead.\\
\end{guitar}
