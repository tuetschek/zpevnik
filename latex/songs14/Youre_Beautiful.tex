^ [C] My life is brilliant,[C/B] my love is pure\\

\begin{guitar}
Yes, she caught my eye, as we walked on by\\
She could see from my face that I was fuckin' high\\
And I don't think that I'll see her again\\
But we shared a moment that will last till the end\\

\begin{guitar}
You're beautiful, you're beautiful\\
You're beautiful, it's true\\
There must be an angel with a smile on her face\\
^ When she [F9]thought up that I should [G]be with you.[C][G][Am7]\\
^ But it's [F9]time to [G]face the [Am7]truth,\\
^ I will [F9]never [G]be with [C]you.\\
