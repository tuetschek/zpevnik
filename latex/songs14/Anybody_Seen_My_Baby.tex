\songpart{1.}
\begin{guitar}
She confessed her love to me, then she vanished on the breeze,\\
trying to hold on to that was just impossible.\\
She was more than beautiful, closer to ethereal\\
with a kind of down to earth flavor.\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
^ [Am]Close my eyes, it's three in the afternoon\\
^ then I realize that she's really gone for [Em]good\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Chorus 1:}
\begin{guitar}
^ Anybody s[C]een [D]my [Hm]bab[Em]y, anybody [C]seen [D]her a[Em]round?\\
^ Love has gone and [C]made me [D]blind,\\
^ I've loo[Hm]ked but i just can't [Em]find.\\
^ She has gotten [C]lost [D]in the [Em]crowd.\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{2.}
\begin{guitar}
I was flippin' magazines, in the place of Mercer street\\
when I thought I spotted her.\\
Getting on a motorbike, looking rather ladylike\\
didn't she just give me a wave?\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
Salty tears, it's three in the afternoon,\\
has she disappeared, is she really gone for good?\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Chorus 2:}
\begin{guitar}
Anybody seen my baby, anybody seen her around?\\
If I just-just close my eyes, \\
I reach out and touch the prize.\\
Anybody seen her around?\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Rap solo}

\songpart{Chorus 2 2x}

\songpart{Outro:}
\begin{guitar}
Lost, lost and never found, \\
I must have called her a thousand times.\\
Something I think she's just in my imagination, \\
lost in the crowd...\\
\end{guitar}
\end{song}
