\songpart{Intro:}
\begin{guitar}
^ A [G]long, [D]long [Em]time ago, [Am]I can still re[C]member, \\
^ how that [Em]music used to [D]make me smile.\\
^ And I [G]knew that if I [D]had my [Em]chance, \\
^ that [Am]I could make those [C]people dance,\\
^ and [Em]maybe they'd be [C]happy for a [D]while.\\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
^ But [Em]February [Am]made me shiver, with [Em]every paper [Am]I'd deliver.  \\
^ [C]Bad news [G]on the [Am]doorstep; I [C]couldn't take [D]one more step  \\
^ I [G]can't re[D]member [Em]if I cried, when I [Am]read about his [D]widowed bride;\\
^ [G]something [D]touched me [Em]deep inside, the [C]day the [D7]music [G]died[C]. [G]\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{R:}
\begin{guitar}
^ So, [G]bye-[C]bye, Miss [G]American [D]Pie, \\
^ drove my [G]Chevy to the [C]levee but the [G]levee was [D]dry. \\
^ Them [G]good old [C]boys were drinkin' [G]whiskey and [D]rye, \\
^ singing [Em]this'll be the day that I [A7]die, \\
^ [Em]this'll be the day that I [D7]die.\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{1.}
\begin{guitar}
^ [G]Did you write the [Am]book of love, \\
^ and do [C]you have faith in [Am]God above \\
^ if the [Em]Bible [D]tells you so? \\
^ Now do [G]you be[D]lieve in [Em]rock'n roll,  \\
^ can [Am]music save your [C]mortal soul?  \\
^ And [Em]can you teach me how to [A7]dance real [D7]slow?\\
^ Well I [Em]know that you're in [Am]love with him, \\
^ 'cause I [Em]saw you dancin' [Am]in the gym\\
^ You [C]both [G]kicked off your [A7]shoes, \\
^ man I [C]dig those rhythm and [D7]blues!\\
^ I was a [G]lonely [D]teenage [Em]broncin' buck, \\
^ with a [Am]pink carnation and a [C]pick-up truck.\\
^ But I [G]knew [D]I was [Em]out of luck \\
^ the [C]day the [D7]music [G]die[C]d.[G] \\
^ [G]I started [D7]singing....     \\

\begin{guitar}
Now for ten years, we've been on our own \\
and moss grows fat on a rollin' stone,\\
but that's not how it used to be. \\
When the jester sang for the king and queen, \\ 
in a coat he borrowed from James Dean, \\
and a voice that came from you and me, \\
Oh, and while the king was looking down, \\
the jester stole his thorny crown;\\
the court room was adjourned, \\
no verdict was returned.\\
And while Lenin read a book of Marx, \\
the quartet practiced in the park, \\
and we sang dirges in the dark, 
the day the music died. \\
We were singing... \\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
Helter skelter in the summer swelter, \\
the birds flew off with a fallout shelter,\\
eight miles high and falling fast. \\
It landed foul on the grass,\\
the players tried for a forward pass,\\
with the jester on the sidelines in a cast.\\
The half time air was sweet perfume, \\
while the sergeants played a marching tune.\\
we all got up to dance, \\ 
but we never got the chance. \\
'Cause the players tried to take the field,\\
but the marching band refused to yield\\
Do you recall what was revealed,
the day the music died?\\
We started singing... \\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
Oh, and there we were all in one place,\\
a generation lost in space;\\
with no time left to start again.\\
So come on: Jack be nimble, jack be quick,\\
Jack flash sat on a candlestick,\\
'cause fire is the devil's only friend.\\
And as I watched him on the stage,\\
my hands were clenched in fists of rage.\\
No angel born in hell\\
could break that Satanâ€™s spell\\
And as the flames climbed high into the night\\
to light the sacrificial rite,\\
I saw Satan laughing with delight,\\
the day the music died.    \\
We were singing... \\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Intro:}
\begin{guitar}
I met a girl who sang the blues, so I asked her for some happy news;\\
but she just smiled and turned away.\\
I went down to the sacred store,\\
where I heard the music years before,\\
but the man there said the music wouldn't play. \\
\end{guitar}

\begin{guitar}
And in the streets the children screamed, the lovers cried and the poets dreamed.\\
But not a word was spoken, the church bells all were broken.\\
And the three men I admire most: the Father, Son and the Holy Ghost\\
They caught the last train for the coast the day the music died.\\
And they were singing...\\
\end{guitar}
