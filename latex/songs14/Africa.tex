\begin{guitar}
^ [A]I hear the drums [E/C#]echoing to[F#m]night\\
^ But [E]she hears only [G/D]whispers of some [D/E]quiet conver[A]sation[G][F#][B]\\
^ [A]She's coming [E/C#]in twelve-thirty [F#m]flight\\
^ The [E]moonlit wings re[G/D]flect the stars that [D/E]guide me towards sal[A]vation[G][F#][B]\\
^ [A]I stopped an [E/C#]old man along the [F#m]way\\
^ [E]Hoping to find some [G/D]long forgotten [D/E]words or ancient [A]melodies[G][F#][B]\\
^ [A]He turned to [E/C#]me as if to [F#m]say, “Hurry boy, its [G]waiting there for you!”[F#][B]\\

\songpart{2.}
\begin{guitar}
The wild dogs cry out in the night\\
As they grow restless longing for some solitary company\\
I know that I must do what's right\\
Sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti\\
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Chorus}
\begin{guitar}
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you\\
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do\\
I bless the rains down in Africa (5x)\\
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had\\
