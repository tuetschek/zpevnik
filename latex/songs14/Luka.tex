\songpart{2.}
\begin{guitar}
I think it's because I'm clumsy\\
I try not to talk too loud\\
Maybe it's because I'm crazy\\
I try not to act too proud\\
They only hit you until you cry\\
And after that you don't ask why\\
You just don't argue anymore\\
You just don't argue anymore\\
You just don't argue anymore\\

\songpart{3.}
\begin{guitar}
Yes I think I'm OK\\
I walked into the door again\\
Well, if you ask that's what I'll say\\
And it's not your business anyway\\
I guess I'd like to be alone\\
With nothing broken, nothing thrown\\
Just don't ask me how I am\\
Just don't ask me how I am\\
Just don't ask me how I am\\
\end{guitar}
