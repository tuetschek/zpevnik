\begin{guitar}
I feel the love and I feel it burn\\
Down this river, every turn\\
Hope is a four-letter word\\
Make that money, watch it burn\\
Oh, but I'm not that old\\
Young, but I'm not that bold\\
I don't think the world is sold\\
I'm just doing what we're told\\
  I feel something so wrong\\
Doing the right thing\\
I could lie, could lie, could lie\\
Everything that drowns me makes me wanna fly\\
