\begin{song}{Homeward Bound}{Simon \& Garfunkel}
\begin{guitar}
^ I'm [A]sitting in the railway station.\\
^ Got a [Amaj7]ticket for my destinati[A7]on, mm[F#]mm\\
^ [Bm]On a tour of one-night stands my [G]suitcase and guitar in hand.\\
^ And [A]ev'ry stop is neatly planned for a [E7]poet and one-man [A]band.\\
\end{guitar}


\songpart{Chorus:}
\begin{guitar}
^ Homeward [D]bound,  wish [A]I was, homeward [D]bound,\\
^ [A]Home where my [Asus4]thought's escaping\\
^ [A]Home where my [Asus4]music's playing,\\
^ [A]Home where my [Asus4]love lays waiting [E]silently for[A] me.\\
\end{guitar}


\begin{guitar}
Ev'ry day's an endless stream\\
Of cigarettes and magazines, mmmm\\
And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories\\
And ev'ry stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be,\\
\end{guitar}


\songpart{Chorus}

\begin{guitar}
Tonight I'll sing my songs again,\\
I'll play the game and pretend, mmmm\\
But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity\\
Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me.\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Chorus}
\begin{guitar}
^ [Amaj7]  Silently f[A7]or me.[A]\\
\end{guitar}
