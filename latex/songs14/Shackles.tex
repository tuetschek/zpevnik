\songpart{Chorus:}
\begin{guitar}
^ Take the [Gm]shackles off my feet so I can [Cm]dance\\

^ You [Gm]broke the chains now I can lift my [Cm]hands\\

\end{guitar}


\songpart{1.}
\begin{guitar}
^ In the [Gm]corners of mind, \\
^ I just can't [Cm]seem to find\\
^ a reason to be[D]lieve \\
^ that I can [Gm]break free\\
^ Cause you see, I have been [Gm]down for so long\\
^ Feel like the [Cm]hope is gone\\
^ But as I lift my [D]hands, I understand\\
^ That I should [Gm]praise you through my circumstance\\
\end{guitar}


\songpart{Chorus}

\songpart{2.}
\begin{guitar}
Everything that could go wrong\\
All went wrong at one time\\
So much pressure fell on me\\
I thought I was gonna lose my mind\\
But I know you wanna see\\
If I will hold on through these trials\\
But I need you to lift this load\\
Cause I can't take it anymore\\
\end{guitar}


\songpart{Chorus}


\songpart{Bridge:}
\begin{guitar}
^ Been [Gm]through the fire and the rain\\
^ [Cm]Bound in every kind of way\\
^ But G[D]od has broken every chain\\
^ So l[Gm]et me go right now\\
\end{guitar}


\songpart{Chorus 3x}
