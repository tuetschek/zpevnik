\songpart{1.}
\begin{guitar}
^ [F#m]The moment I wake u[D]p\\
^ Before I put [E]on my mak[A]eup\\
^ I s[D]ay a little prayer for [C#]you\\
^ [F#m]While combing my [D]hair, now,\\
^ And wondering what dr[E]ess to w[A]ear, now,\\
^ I s[D]ay a little prayer [C#]for you\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Chorus:}
\begin{guitar}
^ [D]Forever and [E]ever, you'll [E]stay in my [F#m]heart\\
^ and I will l[E]ove you\\
Forever, forever, we never will part\\
Oh, how I'll love you\\
Together, together, that's how it must be\\
To live without you\\
^ [D]Would only be[E] heartbreak f[C#]or me.\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{2.}
\begin{guitar}
I run for the bus, dear,\\
While riding I think of us, dear,\\
I say a little prayer for you.\\
At work I just take time\\
And all through my coffee break-time,\\
I say a little prayer for you.\\
\end{guitar}

\songpart{Chorus 2x}

\songpart{Bridge:}
\begin{guitar}
^ [F#m]My darling beli[D]eve me,\\
^ For me the[E]re is no one\\
^ [A]But you, please love me true, I'm in love with you\\
^ [A]Answer my prayer, say you love me true.\\
This is my prayer, baby...\\
