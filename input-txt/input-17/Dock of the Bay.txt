Sittin' On The Dock Of The Bay
Otis Redding


Verse 1: 
G                      B7
Sittin' in the mornin' sun
        C                        A
I'll be sittin' when the evenin' comes
G                       B7
Watching the ships roll in
           C                    A
And then I watch 'em roll away again, yeah


Chorus:
    G                          E
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
             G          E
Watching the tide roll away
              G                          A
Ooo, I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay
        G  E
Wastin' ti--me

 
Verse 2:
I left my home in Georgia
Headed for the 'Frisco Bay
'Cause I've had nothing to live for
And look like nothin's gonna come my way
 
Chorus

 
Bridge: 
G     D     C               G
Looks like, nothing's gonna change
G    D             C         G
Everything still remains the same
G       D       C          G
I can't do what ten people tell me to do
F                 D
So I guess I'll remain the same, yes


Verse 3: 
Sittin' here resting my bones
And this loneliness won't leave me alone
It's two thousand miles I roamed
Just to make this dock my home
 
Chorus
