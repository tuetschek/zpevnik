Always Remember Us This Way
Lady Gaga

Verse 1:
             Am                  F
That Arizona sky burning in your eyes
    C                                      G
You look at me and, babe, I wanna catch on fire
                  Am                   F
It’s buried in my soul like California gold
    C                                     G
You found the light in me that I couldn’t find
 
Chorus:
            F                                  C
So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
      Am                           G
Every time we say goodbye baby, it hurts
         F   G    Am              F   G     C
When the sun goes down - And the band won't play
     F       G               C
I'll always remember us this way
 
Verse 2: 
Lovers in the night poets trying to write
We don't know how to rhyme but damn we try
But all I really know you're where I wanna go
The part of me that's you will never die
 
Chorus 
           F        G              Bb         Bb
[...] I'll always remember us this way - Oh, yeah
 
 Bridge:
F                                     C
I don't wanna be just a memory, baby, yeah
C
Hoo-oo-oo, hoo-oo-oo, oo - oo.
Bb
Hoo-oo-oo, hoo-oo-oo, oo - oo.
F                              G
Hoo-oo-oo, hoo-oo-oo, oo ----- oo.
 
 
Chorus
           F        G              Am
[...] I'll always remember us this way – Wo-o-yeah
 
 
Outro:
         F    G  Am         F     G     C
When you look at me and the whole world fades
     F       G                   F   Bb  F  C
I'll always remember us this way
