Little Talks
Of Monsters and Men

Intro:
[: Am   Fmaj7   C   G :] 4x


Am                Fmaj7  C
Don't listen to a word I say
Am              Fmaj7     C
The screams all sound the same

Verse 1:
Am           Fmaj7               C                  
I don't like walking around this old and empty house
   Am                 F                C
So hold my hand, I'll walk with you my dear
    Am           Fmaj7            C
The stairs creak as I sleep, it's keeping me awake
         Am            F                 C
It's the house telling you to close your eyes
Am        Fmaj7         C
Some days I can't even  trust myself
     Am            F            C
It's killing me to see you this way


Chorus:
                  Am        Fmaj7    
'Cause though the truth may vary
     C         G         Am     Fmaj7   C
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore 
[: Am   Fmaj7   C   G :] 4x


Verse 2:
There's an old voice in my head that's holding me back
Well tell her that I miss our little talks
Soon it will be over and buried with our past
We used to play outside when we were young (and full of life and full of love)
Some days I don't know if I am wrong or right
Your mind is playing tricks on you my dear

Chorus

Verse 3:
You're gone, gone, gone away. I watched you disappear
All that's left is a ghost of you
Now we're torn, torn, torn apart, there's nothing we can do. 
Just let me go, we'll meet again soon.
Now wait, wait, wait for me. Please hang around
I'll see you when I fall asleep.

Chorus (2x):
Am                Fmaj7  C     G
Don't listen to a word I say
Am              Fmaj7      C     G
The screams all sound the same
               Am        Fmaj7    
And though the truth may vary
     C         G         Am     Fmaj7   C     G
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore 

Outro:
[: Though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore :]
