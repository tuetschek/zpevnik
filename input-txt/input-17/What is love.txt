What is Love
Haddaway / Kiesza


1.
Am            C                   Em                   
  Oh, I don't know why you're not there 
              G                       Am
I gave you my love, but you just don't care 
      C            Em
Was I right, was I wrong, 
          G
give me a sign 

Chorus 2x:
        F                 Am
What is love, baby, don't hurt me 
      C          G
Don't hurt me no more 

2.
Oh, I don't know, what can I do 
What can I say, it's up to you 
I know we're right, just me and you, 
I can't go on 

Chorus 2x

Solo on verse

Bridge:
F          G               Am
 I want no other, no other lover 
             Em                 F
This is your life, but it's our time 
              G                     Am
When we are together, I need you forever 
      Em
Is it love?

Chorus 2x
