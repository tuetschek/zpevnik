Verse 1:
C              G         C              G
There's a calm surrender to the rush of day
C                    G             Am7            D
When the heat of the rolling world can be turned away
C            G      C              G
An enchanted moment and it sees me through
C                    Em               F               D
It's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you

    G       D/F#     Em      C
And can you feel the love tonight?
G      C     A/C# D
 It is where we   are
C           G         Em   G/D   C
 It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
Am   G/B  C A/C#  D
That we got this far
    G       D/F#     Em     C
And can you feel the love tonight?
G         C    A/C# D
 How it's laid to   rest?
C           G        Em    G/D    C
 It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
  Am    G/B  C    C/G   G
Believe the  ve - ry    best


Repeat intro

Verse 2:
There's a time for everyone, if they only learn
That the twisting kaleidoscope moves us all in turn
There's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours


Chorus

Outro:
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the  very  best
