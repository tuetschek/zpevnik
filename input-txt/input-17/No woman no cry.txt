1.
C         G      Am                  F
 Said I remember when we used to sit
C                  G       Am         F      
 In the government yard in Trenchtown
C       G         Am             F 
 Oba, oba-serving the hypocrites 
        C            G                    Am        F
As they would mingle with the good people we meet   (Yeah...)
   
Good friends we have, oh good friends we've lost 
along the way    (Yeah...)
In this great future you can't forget your past
So dry your tears I say

Chorus:
And No woman, no cry
No  woman, no cry
Dear Little darlin', don't shed no tears
No  woman, no cry
Said, said...

2.
Said I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
And then Georgie would make the fire lights,
as it was, like a wood burnin' through the night

Then we would cook cornmeal porridge
Of which I'll share with you, (oooh).
My feet is my only carriage
So I've got to push on through. (But, while I'm gone, I mean...)

Bridge:
   C                  G
[: Everything's gonna be all right!
Am                 Fm7
Everything's gonna be all right, (I say) :] 4x


Chorus:
So woman, no cry
No  woman,  no cry
oh no Little sister,  don't shed no tears
No  woman,  no cry
