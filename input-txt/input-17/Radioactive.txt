Verse 1:
Bm           D             A
  I'm waking up to ash and dust
          E                    Bm
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
              D             A   N.C.
I'm breathing in the chemicals


Prechorus:
Bm             D           A                 E                  
  I'm breaking in, shaping up, then checking out on the prison bus
Bm        D            A          E
  This is it, the apocalypse, Who-a


Chorus:
           Bm            D
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
 A                E
Enough to make my systems blow
Bm                     D
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
A                      E
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Bm     D         A            E
  Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive
Bm     D         A            E
  Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive
 

Verse 2:
I raise my flags, don my clothes
It's a revolution, I suppose
We're painted red to fit right in, whoa
I'm breaking in, shaping up, then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse, Whoa

Deep in my bones, straight from inside
