G              Em             D                       C          G
  Almost Heaven, West Virginia, Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River.
G                    Em                    D                           C              G

West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads.
 

Verse 2:
All my memories  gather 'round her, miner's lady, stranger to blue water.
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky, misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye.
 
Chorus


Bridge:
Em          D/F#          G
 I hear her voice, in the mornin' hour she calls me.
    C       G              D
The radio reminds me of my home far away.
    Em               F            C              G
And drivin' down the road I get a feelin' that I should have been home 
D                D7
yesterday, yesterday.

Take me home, (down) country roads.
