Penny Lane
The Beatles
 
1. 
         A               F#m            Bm        E7
In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
         A                 F#m         Am
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
            F#dim                Fmaj7       E7
And all the people that come and go stop and say hello

2. 
On the corner is a banker with a motor car
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac in the pouring rain, 
D
very strange

Chorus: 
      G             Bm             C
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
G                 Bm            C               E7
There beneath the blue suburban skies I sit and meanwhile back


3. 
In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hour glass  
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean, it's a clean machine

Solo on verse

Chorus:
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
A four of fish and finger pies in summer meanwhile back


4. 
Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play   she is anyway
 
5. 
In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in from the pouring rain   very strange
 

Chorus:
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies I sit and meanwhile back
 
       A            C#m7           D
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
A                 C#m7          D              A
There beneath the blue suburban skies... Penny Lane
