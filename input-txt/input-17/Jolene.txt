  C#m     E       B       C#m
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
    B                                    C#m

   C#m    E       B       C#m

1.
       C#m       E
Your beauty is beyond compare
       B                C#m
With flaming locks of auburn hair
       B             G#m             C#m
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
       C#m            E 
Your smile is like a breath of spring
       B                  C#m
Your voice is soft like summer rain
       B         G#m            C#m
And I cannot compete with you, Jolene

2.
He talks about you in his sleep
There's nothing I can do to keep
From crying when he calls your name, Jolene
And I can easily understand 
How you could easily take my man
But you don't know what he means to me, Jolene

Chorus

3.
you could have your choice of men
But I could never love again
He's the only one for me, Jolene
I had to have this talk with you 
My happines depends on you
Whatever you decide to do, Jolene
