Wake Me Up
Avicii

Intro:
[: C#m  A   E   B  :]

Verse 1:
C#m         A              E      E
Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can’t tell where the journey will end
But I know where it starts

They tell me I’m too young to understand
They say I’m caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don’t open up my eyes
Well that’s fine by me

Chorus:
              C#m     A        E    B
[: So wake me up when it’s all over
When I’m wiser and I’m older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn’t know I was lost

Verse 2:
I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
Hope I get the chance to travel the world
And I don’t have any plans

Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life’s a game made for everyone
And love is a prize


Chorus

Outro:
            C#m         A     E     B     
And I, [: I didn’t know I was lost   :]
