Take Me To Church
Hozier

Em               Am    
  My lover's got humour
Em                      Am     
  She's the giggle at a funeral
G                        Am  
  Knows everybody's disapproval
Em                           Am    
  I should've worshipped her sooner
Em                    Am     
  If the Heavens ever did speak
Em                     Am   
  She is the last true mouthpiece
G                        Am     
  Every Sunday's getting more bleak
Em               Am 
  A fresh poison each week
D                    C                  
 'We were born sick,  you heard them say it

My church offers no absolutes
She tells me 'worship in the bedroom'
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it

C
Command me to be well
  G  C G    Cm  G    Cm G    G F#
Aaaa a-men. Aaa-men. Aa-men.   

Chorus (2x):
F#    F     Em
 Take me to church
                                               B7
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
                                                G
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
                 Am
Offer me that deathless death
     Em                      Am G
Good God, let me give you my life

Verse 2:
If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the Goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
To drain the whole sea, get something shiny

Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty, That looks plenty

C                   G F#
This is hungry work

Chorus 2x

Bridge:
C               G              B7       Em
  No masters or kings when the ritual begins
         C          G              B7         Em
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
       C           G            B7          Em
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
     C         G           B7        Em     D     C
Only then I am human, only then I am clean
  G  C G    Cm  G    Cm G    G F#
Aaaa a-men. Aaa-men. Aa-men.   


Chorus 2x
