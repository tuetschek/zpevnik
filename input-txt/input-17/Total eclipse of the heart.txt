Total Eclipse of the Heart
Bonnie Tyler

Verse: 
Am   
(Turn around) Every now and then I get a
G
little bit lonely, and you're never coming round,
Am
(Turn around) Every now and then I get a 
G
little bit tired of listening to the sound of my tears
C   
(Turn around) Every now and then I get a
Bb 
little bit nervous that the best of all the years have gone by
C
(Turn around) Every now and then I get a 
Bb
little bit terrified and then I see the look in your eyes
Eb            Ab
(Turn around, Bright eyes) Every now and then I fall apart
Eb            Ab                                     G
(Turn around, Bright eyes) Every now and then I fall apart

 
Chorus:
      Em9             C            D                  G
And I need you now, tonight, and I need you more than ever
           Em9          C              D             G
And if you only hold me tight we'll be holding on forever
          Em                C                  D
And we'll only be making it right 'cause we'll never be wrong
  C                            D
Together we can take it to the end of the line
     Em                          A
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time
  G                             D
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark
      Em                         A
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks
                     G        D/F#         G       C
I really need you tonight, forever's gonna start tonight
   D
Forever's gonna start tonight

 
G                      Em7            
Once upon a time I was falling in love
    B7                    C      C/D
but now I'm only falling apart
        Am                  D                    G    Em9  C   D
There's nothing I can do, a total eclipse of the heart
G                          Em7 
Once upon a time there was light in my life 
    B7                           C     C/D
but now there's only love in the dark
Am                   D                    G    Em7   C   D   G
Nothing I can say, a total eclipse of the heart
