I Heard It Through the Grapevine
Marvin Gaye


Intro:
[: Dm  G/D  Dm  G/D  Dm :] 5x


Verse 1:
       Dm                   G/D   Dm
Ooh, I bet you're wonderin' how I knew,
           A7               G7
'Bout your plans to make me blue.
                Dm      G/D     Dm
With some other guy you knew be-fore,
                  A7                         G7
Between two of us guys, you know I loved you more.
                  Bm            G7
It took me by sur-prise, I must say,
       Dm               G7
When I found out yester-day. Don't you know that;


Chorus: 
  Dm                   G/D   Dm
I heard it through the grape-vine;
         G7           
Not much longer, would you be mine.
      Dm                   G/D   Dm
Oh, I heard it through the grape-vine;
        G7                         (N.C.)              Dm
Oh, I'm just about to lose my mind,      honey, honey, yeah.
   Dm
(I heard it through the grapevine,
                          G/D Dm       G/D  Dm  G/D
Not much longer would you be  my baby).


Verse 2:
I know a man ain't sup-posed to cry,
But these tears, I can't hold in-side.
Losing you, would end my life, you see,
'Cos you mean that much to me.
You could have told me your-self,
That you loved someone else. Instead...

Verse 3:
People say; believe half of what you see,
Son, and none of what you hear.
But I can't help, but be confused,
If it's true, please tell me, dear.
Do you plan to let me go,
For the other guy you loved be-fore?
