Intro:
D Bm D Bm

Verse:
D             Bm
Early morning, she wakes up
    D                          Bm
and knock, knock, knock on the door
D                    Bm
It's time for makeup, perfect smile
     D               Bm
It's you they're all waiting for 
D         Bm           G         A
Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?


Chorus 1:
D               Bm
 She's so lucky, she's a star
        G                      A      
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
D                   Bm
 If there's nothin'   missing in my life
     G            A
Then why do these tears come at night?

Verse:
Lost in an image, in a dream,
But there's no one there to wake her up
        D                          A
And the world is spinning, and she keeps on winning
    Bm                           (No chord)        A
But tell me, what happens when it stops?   They go...
D         Bm           G         A
Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?

Chorus 2:
D               Bm
 She's so lucky, she's a star
        G                      A      F#
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
Bm                   A              D
 If there's nothin'   missing in my life
     G            A
Then why do these tears come at night?

She is so lucky, but why does she cry? 
D                   Bm  
If there is nothin' missing in her life
       G           A
Why do these tears come at night?
