4x [: Em  G  D  A  :]

1.
Em         G
  Today is gonna be the day 
             D                      A            
That they're gonna throw it back to you 
Em           G
  By now you should've somehow 
   D                    A
Realized what you gotta do 
Em                   G
I don't believe that anybody 
D               A            C   D   A   A
Feels the way I do about you now 

2.
Backbeat the word was on the street 
That the fire in your heart is out 
I'm sure you've heard it all before 
But you never really had a doubt 
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now 

Pre-Chorus:
    C                D                      Em     Em
And all the roads we have to walk along are winding 
    C                   D                 Em      Em
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding 
C              D           
There are many things that I would 
G       D/F#   Em        D          A   A  A
Like to say to you but I don't know how

Chorus:
        C    Em  G        Em                    C         Em G
Because maybe      you're gonna be the one that saves me?
    Em    C   Em  G         Em    C    Em  G  Em
And after all,    you're my wonderwall 

Today was gonna be the day 
But they'll never throw it back to you 
By now you should've somehow 
Realized what you're not to do 
I don't believe that anybody 
Feels the way I do about you now 

Pre-Chorus
Chorus 2x
