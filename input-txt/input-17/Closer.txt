Verse 1:
Cadd9  D                Em7                  D
Hey,   I was doing just fine before I met you
            Cadd9                    D         Em7  D
I drank too much and that's an issue  but I'm okay
Cadd9  D             Em7                              D
Hey,   you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
      Cadd9             D    Em7  D
But I hope I never see them again

Prechorus: 
Cadd9               D
   I know it breaks your heart
Em7                          D
Moved to the city in a broke down car and
Cadd9             D
   Four years, no calls
Em7                            D
Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar and
Cadd9  D    Em7  D      Cadd9  D   Em7  D
I    can't stop,    no, I    can't stop

Chorus: 
   Cadd9              D       Em7                   D
So baby pull me closer in the backseat of your Rover
       Cadd9                D
That I know you can't afford
          Em7                    D
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
         Cadd9                      D
Pull the sheets right off the corner
       Em7                    D
Of the mattress that you stole
          Cadd9                   D
From your roommate back in Boulder
         Em7              D
We ain't ever getting older

Verse 2:
You, look as the good as the day as I met you
I forget just why I left you, I was insane
Stay, and play that Blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tuscon, okay
