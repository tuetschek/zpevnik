Girl
Beatles

1.
         Em      B7              Em    Em7
is there anybody going to listen to my story
Am            C6               G      B7
all about the girl who came to stay?
she's the kind of girl you want so much it makes you sorry
still you don't regret a single day


Chorus:
    G   Bm Am D7     G   Bm Am D7
Ah, girl...      ah, girl      


2.
when i think of all the times i've tried so hard to leave her
she will come to me and start to cry
and she promises the earth to me and i bel-ieve her
after all this time i don't know why

Chorus

Bridge:
Am                                  E
she's the kind of girl who puts you down
                                    Am   E
when friends are there, you feel a fool
Am                              
when you say she's looking good
     E                                 Am         C
she acts as if it's understood, she's cool, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh


Chorus

3.
was she told when she was young that pain would lead to pleasure?
did she understand it when they said
that a man must break his back to earn his day of leisure,
will she still believe it when he's dead?


Chorus
