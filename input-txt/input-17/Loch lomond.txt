Loch Lomond

1.
       G             Em       C            D
It was on a summer's night, I got an offie fright
G                 Em           C  D
When I went for a swim in Loch Lo-mond,
Because when I cam oot, my clothes were nae aboot
For some passerby had pinched them in the gloamin'.

And
G                   Em           C                D
I couldnae tak' the high road, I couldnae tak the low road
   G                 Em              C   D
As round and round I stumbled in the gloamin'
I was sich an offie sight when it came on braid daylight
I was carried hame in a blankie fae Loch Lomond.


2.
And another fright I got when I went oot in a boat
On a fishin' expedition in Loch Lomond
For I hooked an offie weight, and I'm tellin' ye noo straight
It took me from that night until next mornin'.

For it wouldnae tak the high road, it wouldnae tak the low road
That beast weighed o'er a ton and I was foamin'
What do ye think I seen, shinin' through two eyes o' green?
It was the Loch Ness monster in Loch Lomond!


3.
So I went upon a spree at a local jubilee
In a house on the banks of Loch Lomond
But I practically got hung when they heered the sang I sung
And threw me oot on the banks o' Loch Lomond

For I couldnae hit the high notes, I couldnae hit the low notes
The master o' the house, he was foamin'
And I clean forgot the air, when he hit me wi' a chair
And flung me oot on the banks o' Loch Lomond.


4.
So, I had a drink or twa before I gae'd awa
In a hotel on the banks o' Loch Lomond
I was clean enjoyin' masel' when they rang the closin' bell
And flung me oot on the banks o' Loch Lomond

For I couldnae see the high road, I couldnae see the low road
As round and round I stumbled in the gloamin'
Next mornin' sich a druith, noo I'm tellin' ye the truth,
I drank a puir o' water fae Loch Lomond.
