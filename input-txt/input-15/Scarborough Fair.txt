Scarborough Fair
Simon & Garfunkel

Dm               Am          Dm
Are you going to Scarborough Fair
Dm                 G      Dm
Parsley sage rosemary and thyme
Dm       Am    Dm            C
Remember me to one who lives there
Dm       C     Am           Dm
She Once was a true love of mine

Tell her to make me a cambric shirt
Parsley sage rosemary and thyme
Without Any seems nor needle work
Then she'll be a true love of mine


Tell her to find me an acre of land
Parsley sage rosemary and thyme
Between the salt water and the sea strands
Then she'll Be a true love of mine


Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather
Parsley sage rosemary and thyme
And Bind it all in a bunch of heather
Then she'll Be a true love of mine

Are you going to Scarborough Fair
Parsley sage rosemary and thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
She Once was a true love of mine
