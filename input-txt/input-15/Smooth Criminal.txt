Smooth Criminal
Michael Jackson

Intro:
Am /  G/B /  C  / G/B G Am

1.
Am                    G/B
  As he came into the window,
           C             G/B    Am
it was the sound of a crescendo.
He came into her apartment,
he left the bloodstains on the carpet.

2.
She ran underneath the table,
he could see she was unable.
So she ran into the bedroom,
she was struck down, it was her doom.

Am                    G              F                E
There's a sign in the window that he struck you – a crescendo, Annie.
Am                 G                  F                  G
He came into your apartment, left the bloodstains on the carpet.
Am                    G                 F                   E
Then you ran into the bedroom, you were struck down, it was your doom.

Annie, are you OK? So Annie, are you OK?
        G     F
Are you OK, Annie?
E           (N.C.)  E           (N.C.)       Am (main riff)
You've been hit by, you've been struck by, a smooth criminal.

3.
So they came into the outway,
it was Sunday – what a black day.
Mouth to mouth resuscitation,
sounding heartbeats – intimidation.
