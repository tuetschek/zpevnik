1.
 E
Billy Ray was a preacher's son
             A                      E
And when his daddy would visit he'd come along

When they'd gather 'round and started talking
B7
That's when Billy would take me walking
A-through the back yard we'd go walking
Then he'd look into my eyes
Lord knows to my surprise

Chorus:
     E
The only one who could ever reach me
A                   E
  Was the son of a preacher man
     E
The only boy who could ever teach me
A                    E
  Was the son of a preacher man
              B    A
Yes he was, he was,     mmm, yes he was

2.
Being good isn't always easy
No matter how hard I'd try
When he started sweet-talkin' to me
He'd come and tell me everything is all right
He'd kiss and tell me everything is all right
Can I get away again tonight

Chorus

Bridge:
          D
(Yes, he was)
                    A
How well I remember  The look was in his eyes

Stealin' kisses from me on the sly
B7
   Takin' time to make time
Tellin' me that he's all mine
E7
  Learnin' from each other's knowin'
Look at us here, how much we've grown

Chorus:
         A
And the only one who could ever reach me
D                    A
  Was the son of a preacher man
     A
The only boy who could ever teach me
D                    A
  Was the son of a preacher man
                E   D7
Yes he was, he was, ooh yes he was

Repeat and fade:
The only one who could ever reach me
He was the sweet-talking... / Was the son of a preacher man,
A kiss-stealin'... / Was the son of a preacher man...
