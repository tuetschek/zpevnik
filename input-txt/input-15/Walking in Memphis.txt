Walking in Memphis
Marc Cohn

F   G     C          Am
Put on my blue suede shoes
      F    G      C    Am 
And I boarded the plane 
F                   G           C     Am
Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues 
F                    G       C   Am  
In the middle of the pouring rain
F  G  C     Am F                   G    C Am 
W. C. Handy,   won't you look down over me 
F            G       C         Am
Yeah I got a first class ticket 
           F         G       C 
But I'm as blue as a boy can be 


Chorus:
C         Am         F      G   C
 Then I'm walking in Memphis 
Am              F        G           C
Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale 
Am         F       G  C
Walking in Memphis 
Am              F        G     Gsus/C
But do I really feel the way I feel? 


Saw the ghost of Elvis 
On Union Avenue
Followed him up to the gates of Graceland 
Then I watched him walk right through 
Now security they did not see him 
They just hovered 'round his tomb 
But there's a pretty little thing, Waiting for the King 
N.C.
Down in the Jungle Room 


Chorus:
When I was walking in Memphis...

Bridge:
Csus4  C   Csus4  C

            Csus4          C     Csus4 C
They've got catfish on the table 
            Csus4         C      Csus4 C
They've got gospel in the air 
                   E7         F
And Reverend Green be glad to see you 
         F#dim         G7     C/G   C
When you haven't got a prayer 
N.C.                           F       G  C  Am   
But boy you've got a prayer in Memphis 


Now Muriel plays piano 
Every Friday at the Hollywood 
And they brought me down to see her 
And they asked me if I would
Do a little number 
And I sang with all my might
And she said, "Tell me are you a Christian child?" 
And I said "Ma'am I am tonight" 

Chorus


Put on my blue suede shoes
And I boarded the plane

In the middle of the pouring rain :|
