This is ground control to Major Tom, you've really made the grade!
         Fm             C/E                   F     
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear,

This is Major Tom to ground con-trol, I'm stepping through the door
And I'm floating in the most peculiar way 
and the stars look very different today
       

Bridge:
    Fmaj7     Em7                   Fmaj7         Em7
For here am I sitting in a tin can, far above the world
Bbmaj7          Am               G             F
Planet Earth is blue and there's nothing I can do

3.
Though I'm passed one hundred thousand miles, I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go, 
tell my wife I love her very much she knows

Ground control to Major Tom: 
      Am                      Am7/G
Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong.
        D7                
Can you hear me Major Tom? 
        C/G
Can you hear me Major Tom? 
        G
Can you hear me Major Tom? Can you...

Bridge:
...here am floating in my tin can, far above the moon
Planet Earth is blue and there's nothing I can do
