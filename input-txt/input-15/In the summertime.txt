In the summertime, when the weather is high,
           E              E6    E
You can stretch right up, and touch the sky,
            A             A6        A                  A6        E   E6
When the weather's right, you got women, you got women on your mind,
E           B            B6    B   A      A6        A       E       E6 E
   Have a drink, have a drive,     go and see what you can find!

If her daddy's rich, take her out for a meal,
If her Daddy's poor, just do what you feel,
Speed a - long the lane, do a ton, or a ton and twenty five,
And when the sun goes down, you can make it, make it good in a lay-by!

3.
We're not grey people, we're not dirty, we're not mean,
We love everybody, but we do as we please,
When the weather's fine, we go fishing, or go swimming in the sea,
We're always happy, life's for living, yeah, that's our philosophy!

4.
Sing a - long with us, 'Dee, dee, dee - dee, dee!
Dah, dah, da - dah, dah!' Yeah, we're hap - happy,
Dah, dah - dah! Dee, dah - dah, dee - dah, dee - dah!
Dah -dah! Dah, dah - dah!    Dee, dah - dah, de - dah,
Dee - dah, dah - dah!  Al -right!


Repeat intro

5.
When the winter's here, yeah, it's party time,
Bring a bottle, wear your bright clothes, it'll soon be summertime,
And we'll sing again, we'll go driving, or maybe we'll settle down,
If she's rich, if she's nice, bring your friends, And we'll all go into town!
