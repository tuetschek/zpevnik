A Hard Day's Night
The Beatles

C9

1.
            G    C9    G                    F              G
It's been a hard day's night, and I've been workin' like a dog
                 C9    G                  F               G
It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleepin' like a log
           C                           D
But when I get home to you, I find the things that you do
             G    C9 G 
They make me feel alright


2.
You know I work all day, to get you money, to buy you things
And it's worth it just to hear you say, you're gonna give me everything
So why on earth should I moan, cause when I get you alone 
you know I'll feel OK

Bridge:
         Bm    Em                     Bm
When I'm home, everything seems to be right
         G     Em                     C      D
When I'm home, feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah
