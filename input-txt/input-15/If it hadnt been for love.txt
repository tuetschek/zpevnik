If It Hadn't Been For Love
Adele

Bm
I never would have hitchhiked to Birmingham

If it hadn't been for love
Bm
I never would have caught the train to Louisiana
      G
If it hadn't been for love
Bm
Never would have run through the blinding rain
  G
Without one dollar to my name
G                        F#                Bm (Riff)
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love

I never would have seen the trouble that I'm in
If it hadn't been for love
I would have been gone like a wayward wind
If it hadn't been for love
Nobody knows it better than me
I wouldn't be wishing I was free
      G                   F#               Bm  (Walk up to D)
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love

Chorus:
D         A      Em        D
Four cold walls against my will
   D       A         Em    D
At least I know he's lying still
D         A         Em    D
Four cold walls without parole
D          A    Em    D
Lord have mercy on my soul


Never would have gone to that side of town
If it hadn't been for love
Never would have took a mind to track him down
If it hadn't been for love.
I never would have loaded up a .44
Put myself behind a jail house door
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love.

Chorus

I never would have hitchhiked to Birmingham
If it hadn't been for love
I never would have caught the train to Louisiana
If it hadn't been for love
I never would have loaded up a .44
Put myself behind a jail house door
