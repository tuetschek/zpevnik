If God had a name, what would it be?
              Em             C        
And would you call it to his face, 
G           D                 Em      C
if you were faced with him in all his glory,
G              D               Em       C         G   D
what would you ask, if you had just one question?

Chorus:
Cmaj7       G      D
Yeah, yeah, God is great 
Cmaj7       G      D
Yeah, yeah, God is good
Cmaj7       D       
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

        Em      C      G   D
What if God was one of us?
       Em        C      G   D
Just a slob like one of us?
       Em       C      G             D            Em   C  G  D
Just a stranger on the bus trying to make his way home

If God had a face, what would it look like 
And would you want to see,
if seeing meant that you would have to believe, 
in things like heaven and in Jesus and the saints and all the prophets

Chorus

          D            Em   C  G
Trying to make his way home...
Like up to heaven all alone...
Nobody calling on the phone...
'xcept for the Pope, maybe in Rome.

Solo

Chorus

Just trying to make his way home...
Like a holy rolling stone
Back up to heaven all alone
Just trying to make his way home...

       D              Em    G
Nobody calling on the phone...
               D              Em
'xcept for the Pope, maybe in Rome.
