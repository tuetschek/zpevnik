Chorus:
                       C                       G
Well you only need the light when it's burning low
              D                     Em
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
               C                         G       D
Only know your love her when you let her go
                      C                        G
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
              D                        Em
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
              C                            G      D
Only know you love her when you've let her go

Verse 1:
Em                            C
Staring at the bottom of your glass
        D                        Bm
Hoping one day'will make a dream last
               Em               C          D
The dreams come slow and goes so fast
    Em                          C
You see her when you close your eyes
      D                         Bm
Maybe one day you'll understand why
               Em           C         D
Everything you touch surely dies


Chorus:
But you only...


Verse 2:
Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
Love comes slow and it goes so fast
Well you see her when you fall asleep
But to never to touch and never to keep
Because you loved her too much, and you dive too deep


Chorus

Bridge:
And you let her go, ooooo ooooo oooooo
And you let her go, ooooo ooooo oooooo
And you let her go....

Chorus 2x
