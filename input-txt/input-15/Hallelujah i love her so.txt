Hallelujah I Love Her So
Ray Charles

1.
F        F/A              Bb     C7+5
  Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know
F           F/A          Bb         C11
  She is my baby and she lives next door
F13                        Cb9-5
   Every mornin' 'fore the sun comes up
Bb9                           Bdim
   She brings me coffee in my favorite cup
             F    F/E     F/Eb
That's why I know, yes, I know
Dm7-5  G7-9          C11      F
  Hallelujah, I just love her so

2.
When I'm in trouble and I have no friend
I know she'll go with me until the end
Everybody asks me how I know
I smile at them and say, “She told me so”
That's why I know, oh, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so

Bb9                       Bdim
Now, if I call her on the telephone
F/C                     F9+5
  And tell her that I'm all alone
Bb9                        Bdim
  By the time I count from one to four
  G7           A7 D7 G7   C7
I hear her ... on my door

In the evening when the sun goes down
When there is nobody else around
She kisses me and she holds me tight
And tells me, “Daddy, everything's all right”
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so

Oh, hallelujah
Don't you know, I just love her so
