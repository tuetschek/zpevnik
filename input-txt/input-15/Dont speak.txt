Don't Speak
No Doubt

Bm         F#m            Em           
You and me we used to be together
A     F#m        Em        A
Every day together, always
Bm         F#m          Em        A
I really feel that I'm losing my best friend
  F#m                Bm       Em      A
I can't believe this could be the end
   Bm       F#m         Em        A 
It looks as though you're letting go
    D                  A               B
And if it's real, well I don't want to know

Chorus:
Em             C                     D
Don't speak, I know just what you're saying
B                Am
So please stop explaining
      B                 Em     Am  B
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
Em           C                  D
Don't speak, I know what you're thinking
    B                 Am
And I don't need your reasons,
      B                 Em       Am   B
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts


Bm           F#m          Em      
Our memories they can be inviting
             A          F#m    Em         A
But some are altogether mighty frightening
Bm    F#m   Em   A         
As we die, both you and I
D                  A               B
With my head in my hands I sit and cry

Chorus
            B                 E5   D5  B5  G5
(...) Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
C        Em7
It's all ending         
        Bb      F              G#5 C5 D5    C5 D5 G5 
I gotta stop pretending who we are...

Solo:
Bm F#m Em A 3x  Bm F#m Em
  

Bm        F#m   Em           A       Em      A
You and me      I can see us dying...are we? 

Chorus

Am      B              Em
Don't tell me cause it hurts! 
C                  D
I know what you're saying
B                Am
So please stop explaining
B            Em           Am      B    Em
Don't speak, don't speak, don't speak, oh
C                  D
I know what you're thinking 
    B                 Am
And I don't need your reasons 
B                   Em
I know you're good, I know you're good, 
       C       B
I know you're real good, oh 

Fade out
Oh, la la la la la la La la la la la la 
Don't, don't, uh-huh hush, hush darlin' 
Hush, hush darlin' hush, hush 
don't tell me tell me 'cause it hurts 
Hush, hush darlin', hush, hush darlin' 
Hush, hush don't tell me tell me, 'cause it hurts
