1.
C               G           Am
Slip inside the eye of your mind
          E              F
Don't you know you might find
G                   C    |  Am G |
  A better place to play
C             G           Am
You said that you'd never been
            E                  F
But all the things that you've seen
G              C   | Am G |
  Slowly fade away


F                  Fm             C
  So I start a revolution from my bed
         F                 Fm             C
'Cos you said the brains I had went to my head
F                 Fm              C      
Step outside, the summertime's in bloom
G                  
Stand up beside the fireplace
G#/E
Take that look from off your face
     Am             G2            F2        G2
'Cos you ain't ever gonna burn my heart ou- t

Chorus 1:
C  G         Am        E              F
So Sally can wait, she knows it's too late
         G          C   Am G
as we're walking on by
    C    G        Am  E               F             G 
Her soul slides away,  but don't look back in anger
             C   G Am E F G C Am G
I heard you say

2.
Take me to the place where you go
Where nobody knows, if it's night or day
Please don't put your life in the hands
of a rock and roll band, who'll throw it all away

I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed...

Chorus 2:
So sally can wait, she knows it's too late as she's walking on by
My soul slides away, but don't look back in anger I heard you say
