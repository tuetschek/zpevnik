Pink Floyd
Comfortably Numb

   Bm                   A
Hello, Is there anybody in there ?
                    G         Em
Just nod if you can hear me
         Bm
Is there anyone at home ?

Come on now, I hear your feeling down
I can ease your pain
And get you on your feet again

Relax, I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?

Chorus:
D                           A
 There is no pain you are receding
D                              A
 A distant ship smoke on the horizon
C                              G
You are only coming through in waves
C                                           G
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
     D                     A
When I was a child I had a fever
   D                        A
My hands felt just like two ballons
C                               G
Now I've got that feeling once again
                               C
I can't explain, you would not understand
                  G
This is not how I am
A (Bm)  C        G                D
I – – – – have become comfortably numb.

Solo (on 1/2 chorus)
I – – have become comfortably numb.


O.K., just a little pinprick
There'll be no more – aaaaaaaah!
But you may feel a little sick

Can you stand up? I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on, it's time to go.

Chorus:
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child, I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown, the dream is gone
And  I have become comfortably numb.

Solo
