Living Next Door To Alice
Smokie


1.
A                                
 Sally called and she got the word,
                                  E       A     E
  She said I suppose you've heard,  about Alice.
       A
When I rushed to the window, and I looked outside
D                             
 I could hardly believe my eyes.
E                                    A              E
 And the big limousine pulled up, in Alice's drive.

Chorus:
      A
Oh, I don’t know why she's leaving, or where she's gonna go,
  D
I guess she's got her reasons but I just don’t wanna know.
           E                                               A    E
'Cause for twenty-four years I’ve been living next door to Alice.
A
Twenty-four years just waiting for the chance
    D
to tell her how I feel and maybe get a second glance.
       E                     D                   A   
Now I gotta get used to not living next door to Alice.

2.
We grew up together, two kids in the park.
We inscribed our initials deep in the bark, me and Alice.
Now she walks out the door with her head held high,
Just for a moment I caught her eye
as the big limousine pulls slowly, out of Alice's drive.


Chorus

3.
And Sally called back and asked how I felt,
and she said I know how to help, get over Alice.
She said, now Alice is gone, but I’m still here,
you know I’ve been waiting for twenty-four years,
(N.C.)
and the big limousine disappeared.

Chorus

No I never get used to not living next door to Alice.
