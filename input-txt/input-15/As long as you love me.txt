As Long As You Love Me
Backstreet Boys

Intro:
F  C Am    G
        As long as you love me

1.
         Am                           F
Although loneliness has always been a friend of mine
    G                       C     C/B
I'm leavin' my life in your hands
Am                            F 
People say I'm crazy and that I am blind
G                   C       C/B
Risking it all in a glance
    Am                              F
And how you got me blind is still a mystery
  G                       C     C/B
I can't get you out of my head
Am                                 F
Don't care what is written in your history
   G              C
As long as you're here with me

Chorus:
             F            C
I don't care who you are, where you're from
Am               G
What you did, as long as you love me
F            C
Who you are, where you're from
           Am               G
Don't care what you did, as long as you love me


2.
Every little thing that you have said and done
Feels like it's deep within me
Doesn't really matter if you're on the run
It seems like we're meant to be


Chorus

F  C  Am  G  F  C  Am  Am/E  E

Bridge
Am                               C
   I've tried to hide it so that no one knows
      F                       F            G         
But I guess it shows when you look into my eyes
Am                               C 
   What you did and where you're comin' from
        F#-7b5   Fmaj7       G          F  C  Am  G 
I don't care, as long as you love me, baby


Repeat chorus and fade
