Boxer
Simon and Garfunkel


C                                             Am
I am just a poor boy though my story's seldom told
       G
I have squandered my resistance
      G7             G6                C
For a pocket full of mumbles, such are promises
             Am            G                 F
All lies and jest, still a man hears what he wants to hear
                   C     G  G7  G6  C
And disregards the rest

When I left my home and my family, I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of a railway station, running scared
Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters
Where the ragged people go
Looking for the places only they would know


Chorus:
        Am         Em
Lie-la-lie, lie-la-lie la lie-la-lie
        Am      G                   F           G   C
Lie la lie, lie-la-lie la la la la lie la la la la lie


Asking only workman's wages I come looking for a job
But I get no offers
Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue
I do declare, there were times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there, lie lie lie lie la

Solo

Chorus

Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone
Going home where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me
Leading me, going home.

In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
And he carries a reminder of ev'ry glove that laid him down
Or cut him till he cried out in his anger and his shame
I am leaving, I am leaving
But the fighter still remains

Chorus (repeat and fade)
