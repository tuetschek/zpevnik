I Got You Babe
Sony & Cher

     D                   G/D 
They say we're young and we don't know
   D                G  C     A
We won't find out unti--l we grow
      D               G/D       
Well, I don't know if all that's true
       D               G    C     A
'Cause you got me, and baby I got you

Chorus:

 D  G/D        D        G/D       D        G/D
Babe,    I got you babe,    I got you babe

They say our love won't pay the rent
Before it's earned, our money's all been spent
I guess that's so, we don't have a pot
But at least I'm sure of all the things we got

Chorus

Bridge:
      Em               A
I got flowers  in the spring
      Em             A
I got you to wear my ring
             D            G/D
And when I'm sad, you're a clown
                                     A     A#
And if I get scared, you're always around

Verse 3:
   D#                G#/D#
So let them say your hair's too long
       D#                  G#     C#        A#
'Cause I don't care, with you I can't go wrong
     D#              G#/D#
Then put your little hand in mine
 D#                    G#       C#       A#
There ain't no hill or mountain we can't climb

Chorus

D#           G#/D#
I got you to hold my hand
D#           A#
I got you to understand
I got you to walk with me
I got you to talk with me
I got you to kiss goodnight
I got you to hold me tight
I got you, I won't let go
I got you to love me so

D# G#/D# D# A#

   G#        D#
I got... you babe

Fade out:
D#  G#/D#      D#       A#
         I got you babe
