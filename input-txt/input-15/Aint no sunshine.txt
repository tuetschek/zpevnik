Ain't No Sunshine
Bill Withers


Am                             Am    Em G Am
  Ain't no sunshine when she's gone.
                          Am   Em G Am
It's not warm when she's away.
                             Em
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone, 
                          Dm
and she's always gone too long,
                 Am   Em G Am
Anytime she goes away.

Wonder this time where she's gone,
Wonder if she's gone to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone,
and this house just ain't no home,
Anytime she goes away.


And |: I know, I know, I know, I know, :| 4x
I know, I know

Hey, I ought to leave the young thing alone,
But ain't no sunshine when she's gone,
only darkness everyday.
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone, 
and this house just ain't no home
|: Anytime she goes away. :| 5x
