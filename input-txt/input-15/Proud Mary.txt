Proud Mary
Creedence Clearwater Revival

Intro:
C A C A C A G F G D

1.
D
Left a good job in the city
Workin' for the man ev'ry night and day 
And I never lost one minute of sleepin'
Worryin' 'bout the way things might have been

Chorus:
A
Big wheel keep on turnin'
Bm
Proud Mary keep on burnin' 
D
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river 

2.
Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis 
Pumped a lot of pain down in New Orleans 
But I never saw the good side of the city 
'Til I hitched a ride on a river boat queen 

Chorus

Repeat intro

3.
If you come down to the river
Bet you gonna find some people who live 
You don't have to worry 'cause you have no money 
People on the river are happy to give

Chorus

Repeat and fade out:
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
