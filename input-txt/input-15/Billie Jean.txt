Intro:
|: Em  F#m/E G/D  F#m/E :|
Bass notes: E B D E D B A B

1.
Em       F#m/E         G/D                F#m/E
 She was more like a beauty queen, from a movie scene,
Em       F#m/E                  G/D        F#m/E    Am7
 I said; don't mind, but what do you mean; I am the one?
                                    Em    F#m/E  G/D
Who will dance on the floor, in the round.
          F#m/E    Am7                                      Em    F#m/E G/D F#m/E
She said; I am the one, who will dance on the floor, in the round.

2.
She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene.
Then every head turned, with eyes that dreamed of being the one,
Who will dance on the floor, in the round.


Bridge:
C                          Em
 People always told me; be careful what you do;
          C                               Em
And don't go around breaking young girl's hearts.
    C                         Em
And mother always told me; be careful of who you love;
       C                                B7
And be careful of what you do, 'cos the lie becomes the truth.

Chorus:
Em      F#m/E   G/D    F#m/E
 Billie Jean is not my lover;
Em            F#m/E     G/D         F#m/E    Am7
 She's just a girl who, claims that I am the one.
                      Em  F#m/E, G/D
But the kid is not my son.
          F#m/E    Am7                        Em F#m/E G/D F#m/E
She says; I am the one, but the kid is not my son.

3.
For forty days and forty nights, the law was on her side.
But who can stand, when she's in demand, her schemes and plans?
'Cos we danced on the floor, in the round.
So take my strong a-dvice; just remember to always think twice.

4.
She told my baby we'd danced 'till three, then she looked a me,
Then showed a photo; my baby cried; his eyes looked like mine.
Go on dance on the floor, in the round, baby.

Bridge:
People always told me; be careful what you do;
And don't go around breaking young girl's hearts.
She came and stood right by me; then the smell of sweet perfume.
This happened much too soon; she called me to her room.

Chorus 2x

Interlude:
|: Em  F#m/E G/D  F#m/E :| Em  F#m/E G/D
          F#m/E    Am7                        Em  F#m/E, G/D  F#m/E
She says; I am the one, but the kid is not my son.
