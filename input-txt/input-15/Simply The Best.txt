Simply the Best
Tina Turner

  F
I call you when I need you, my heart's on fire 
    F
You come to me, come to me wild and wired 
                 Dm 
When you come to me 
                    Bb   Bb
Give me everything I need 
          F
Give me a lifetime of promises and a world of dreams 
Speak the language of love like you know what it means 
ohh, it can't be wrong 
Take my heart and make it stronger baby 

Chorus:
C                  F   
 You're simply the best, better than all the rest 
            Dm                  C7 
Better than anyone, anyone I've ever met 
                  F    
I'm stuck on your heart, I hang on every word you say 
         Dm                 C7        
Tear us apart, baby I would rather be dead 

In your heart I see the stars of every night and every day 
In your eyes I get lost, I get washed away 
Just as long as I'm here in your arms 
I could be in no better place 

Chorus

Bridge:
Bb
 Each time you leave me I start losing control 
       Dm
You're walking away with my heart and my soul 
Bb
 I can feel you even when I'm alone 
C                   D    G Em D7
 Oh baby, don't let go

Chorus:
           G                
You're the best, better than all the rest 
            Em                  D7    
Better than anyone, anyone I've ever met 
                  G            
I'm stuck on your heart, and hang on every word you say 
         Em                 D7   
Tear us apart, baby I would rather be dead
                   G
Oh, You're the best...
