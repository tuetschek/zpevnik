Supreme
Robbie Williams

1. 
Dm             Bb
Oh it seemed forever stopped today
        C           
All the lonely hearts in London
         Fmaj7
Caught a plane and flew away
            Dm                   
And all the best women are married
        Gbmaj7 
All the handsome men are gay
           A        Dm
You feel deprived
 
Yeah are you questioning your size?
Is there a tumour in your humour,
Are there bags under your eyes?
Do you leave dents where you sit,
Are you getting on a bit?
Will you survive, you must survive
 
Chorus:
       A7    Dm Dsus2   Bb
When there's no love in town 
     F                 A
This new century keeps bringing you down
    A7  Dm      Dsus2   Bb
All the places you have been 
                        A
Trying to find a love supreme
               Dm
A love supreme.
 
2.
Oh what are you really looking for?
Another partner in your life
to abuse and to adore?
Is it lovely dovey stuff
Do you need a bit of rough?
Get on your knees
 
Yeah turn down the love songs that you hear
'Cause you can't avoid the sentiment
That echoes in your ear
Saying love will stop the pain 
Saying love will kill the fear
Do you believe? You must believe
 
Chorus

Solo

Dm                       Bb             
I spy with my little eye something beginning with... got my back up
F
And now she's screaming so I've got to turn the track up
A
Sit back and watch the royalties stack up
Dm
I know this girl she likes to switch teams
Bb                                          A
And I'm a fiend but I'm living for a love supreme
 
Chorus
 
   Dm
[:   Come and live a love supreme
Bb
  Don't let it get you down
F                    A
 Everybody lives for love :]
