Where the Wild Roses Grow
Nick Cave & Kylie Minogue

Chorus:
     Gm               Cm Gm 
They call me The Wild Ro-ose
        A#            D
But my name was Elisa Day
          Gm                  Cm Gm
Why they call me it I do not kno-ow
                F     Gm
For my name was Elisa Day 


He:
         Gm                         A#
From the first day I saw her I knew she was the one
       Cm                     D
As she stared in my eyes and smiled
        Gm                         A#
For her lips were the color of the roses
     Cm                       D
They grew down the river, all bloody and wild 

Elisa:
When he knocked on my door and entered the room
My trembling subsided in his sure embrace
He would be my first man, and with a careful hand
He wiped up the tears that ran down my face 

Chorus

He:
On the second day I brought her a flower
She was more beautiful than any woman I'd seen
I said, "Do you know where the wild roses grow
So sweet and scarlet and free?" 

Elisa:
On the second day he came with a single rose
He said: "Give me your loss and your sorrow."
I nodded my head, as I lay on the bed
"If I show you the roses will you follow?" 

Chorus

Elisa:
On the third day he took me to the river
He showed me the roses and we kissed
And the last thing I heard was a muttered word
As he knelt above me with a rock in his fist 

He:
On the last day I took her where the wild roses grow
And she lay on the bank, the wind light as a thief
As I kissed her goodbye, said, "All beauty must die"
And I lent down and planted a rose 'tween her teeth 

Chorus
