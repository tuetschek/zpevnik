1.
Fm    Fm7         Fm6         Bbm6
Ev'ry time that I look in the mirror
All these lines on my  face gettin' clearer
The past is gone
It went by like dusk to dawn

Isn't that the way ev'rybody's got their dues in life to pay?

Chorus 1:
Fm      Eb           
I know, nobody knows 
Db                 Eb
where it comes and where it goes
Fm          Eb
I know it's ev'rybody's sin; 
Dm              Eb             Fm  Fm7 | Fm6 Bbm6 | Fm Fm9 | Fm
you got to lose to know how to win

Verse 2:
Half my life's in books' written pages  
Lived and learned from fools and from sages
You know it's true
All the things come back to you.

Chorus 2:

Sing with me, sing for the years. 
Db                        Eb
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tears.
Fm                   Eb
Sing with me if it's just for today,
Dm7b5              Dbmaj7                  Bbm  C Bbm C Bbm C Bbm C
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

Dream on, dream on, dream on, and dream until your dream comes true.
