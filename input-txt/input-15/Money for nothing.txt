Dire Straits

Am7 - - C D

Am						    
 Now look at them yo-yo's that's the way you do it
Am                         C   D  
You play the guitar on the M.T.V.
Am7   
That ain't workin' that's the way you do it
                      G          Am7
Money for nothin' and chicks for free
   
Now that ain't workin' that's the way you do it
Lemme tell ya them guys ain't dumb
Maybe get a blister on your little finger
Maybe get a blister on your thumb

Chorus:
F                 C
 We gotta install microwave ovens
F                 G    
 Custom kitchen deliveries
Am7
 We gotta move these refrigerators
D                    E        G
 We gotta move these colour TV's


See the little faggot with the earring and the makeup
Yeah buddy that's his own hair
That little faggot got his own jet airplane
That little faggot he's a millionaire

Chorus

Solo

Chorus

I shouldda learned to play the guitar
I shouldda learned to play them drums
Look at that mama, she's got it stickin' in the camera
Man we could have some fun
   
And he's up there, what's that?  Hawaiian noises?
Bangin' on the bongoes like a chimpanzee
That ain't workin' that's the way you do it
Get your money for nothin' and chicks for free

Chorus

Now that ain't workin' that's the way you do it
You play the guitar on the M.T.V.
That ain't workin' that's the way you do it
Money for nothin' and your chicks for free

Am7                                C  D  
 Money for nothin', chicks for free 
Am7                                G  Am7
 Money for nothin', chicks for free
