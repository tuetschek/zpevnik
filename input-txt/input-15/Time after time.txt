Time After Time
Cyndi Lauper

Intro:  
|: F   G   Em   F :|

 F6   C      F6    C         F6   C        F6       C
Lyin' in my bed I hear the clock tick and think of you
 F6    C      F6 C       F6 C      F6      C
Caught up in circles confusion is nothing new
 F    G    Em   F             G      Em
Flash back warm nights almost left behind
 F   G       Em  F         F/G
Suitcase of memories, time after â€“

Sometimes you picture me I'm walkin' too far ahead
You're calling to me, I can't hear what you've said
Then you say go slow, I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

Chorus:
             G                         Am
|: If you're lost you can look and you will find me
F    F/G   C
Time after time
       G                          Am
If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting
F    F/G    C
Time after time :|

Repeat intro

After my picture fades and darkness has turned to gray
Watchin' through windows you're wondering if I'm okay
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time

Chorus

Solo on verse

You say go slow I fall behind
The drum beats out of time

Chorus

Repeat and fade
   F    F/G    C
|: Time after time :|
