    F#m     D  A      F#m    D  A
You are, my fire, the one, desire,

Believe, when I say, I want it that way

But we are two worlds apart, can't reach to
your heart, when you say, that I want it that way


Chorus 1:
        D                         E    F#m
Tell me why, (Ain't nothin' but a heartache)
        D                         E  F#m   
Tell me why, (Ain't nothin' but a mistake)
        D                  E        A
Tell me why, I never wanna hear you say
F#m       E    A
I want it that way


3.
Am I your fire, your one, desire,

   F#m       C#

Bridge:
F#m                      A
Now I can see that we're fallin' apart,
         D                   E
From the way that it used to be, (Yeah)
   F#m                    A
No matter the distance, I want you to know,
     D                   E
That deep down inside of me...

You are, my fire, the one, desire,
You are, You are, You are, You are...

 Ain't nothin' but a heartache,
E                    F# G#m
 Ain't nothin' but a mistake,
E             F#       B
I never wanna hear you say,
G#m       F#   B
I want it that way
