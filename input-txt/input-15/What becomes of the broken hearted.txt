What Becomes Of The Broken Hearted
Jimmy Ruffin

1.  
A                       C#m  
 As I walk this land of broken dreams, 
F#m                 D    E 
  I have visions of many things. 
A                 C#m  
 But happiness is just an illusion, 
F#m                  D      E  
 filled with sadness and confusion. 

Chorus:
B                    D#m  
 What becomes of the broken-hearted, 
G#m                  E  
 who has love that's now departed? 
B                       D#m  
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind, 
D#      E
maybe...

2.   
The roots of love grow all around, 
but for me they come a tumbling down. 
Every day heartaches grow a little stronger, 
I can't stand this pain much longer. 

3.   
I walk in shadows searching for light, 
cold and alone no comfort in sight. 
Hoping and praying for someone who cares, 
always moving and going nowhere.

Chorus

4.   
I'm searching though I don't succeed, 
for someone's love there's a growing need. 
All is lost there's no place for beginning, 
all that's left is an unhappy ending. 

Outro (fade out):
A                    C#m  
 What becomes of the broken-hearted,
F#m                  D     E 
 who has love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind 
I'll be searching everywhere, just to find someone to care, 
I'll be looking every day, I know I'm gonna find a way. 
Nothing's going to stop me now... I'll find a way somehow. 
I'll be looking every day, I know I'm gonna find a way...
