This Is the Life
Amy Macdonald

Intro: 
C#m A E G#m  

1.
        C#m                A
Oh, the wind whistles down the cold dark street tonight 
        E                        G#m
And the people they were dancing to the music vibe 
        C#m
And the boys chase the girls with the curls in their hair 
          A
While the shy tormented youth sit way over there 
        E
And the songs they get louder 
                       G#m
Each one better than before 


Chorus:
                          C#m
|: And you're singing the songs, thinking this is the life 
                         A
And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size 
                E
Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go? 
                         G#m
Where you gonna sleep tonight? :|
                        C#m       A E G#m C#m A E G#m
Where you gonna sleep tonight...


2.
So you're heading down the road in your taxi for four 
And you're waiting outside Jimmy's front door 
But nobody's in and nobody's home 'till four 
So you're sitting there with nothing to do 
Talking about Robert Riger and his motley crew 
And where you're gonna go and where you're gonna sleep tonight 

Chorus 3x
