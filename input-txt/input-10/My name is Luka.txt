Intro 
[: G D C D :]

1.
G            D    
  My name is Luka
C               D      
  I live on the second floor
G                 D     
  I live upstairs from you
C                    D      
  Yes I think you've seen me before 

Chorus 1:
Em            D          
  If you hear something late at night
Em             D              
  Some kind of trouble. Some kind of fight
C            D         
  Just don't ask me what it was
C            D          
  Just don't ask me what it was
C            D           
  Just don't ask me what it was 

2. 
I think it's because I'm clumsy
I try not to talk too loud
Maybe it's because I'm crazy
I try not to act too proud

Chorus 2:
They only hit until you cry
and after that you don't ask why
you just don't argue anymore
you just don't argue anymore
you just don't argue anymore

Solo (intro)

3.
Yes I think I'm okay
I walked into the door again
Well, if you ask that's what I'll say
and it's not your business anyway

Chorus 3:
I guess I'd like to be alone
with nothing broken, nothing thrown 
Just don't ask me how I am
Just don't ask me how I am
Just don't ask me how I am
