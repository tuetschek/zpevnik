All By Myself
Eric Carmen

Intro: 
F 8x

1.
F
When I was young
        Bbm/F         F      Am7-5/Eb
I never needed anyone
           Dsus4    D            Gm
And makin' love was just for fun
Bbm6
Those days are gone

Bridge 1: 
F/A F/A Gm7-5 C/E

2.
Livin' alone
I think of all the friends I've known
But when I dial the telephone
Nobody's home

Bridge 2: 
F/A F/A D7 D G7 C7 C7

Chorus:
F         Am
All by myself
              Am7-5/Eb
Don't wanna be
       D7   Gm      Gm7-5/C#  C7
All by myself anymore
F         Am
All by myself
                Am7-5/Eb
Don't wanna live
       D7   Gm      Gm7-5/C#  C7
All by myself anymore

3.
Hard to be sure
Sometimes I feel so insecure
And love so distant and obscure
Remains the cure

Bridge 1
