Underneath Your Clothes
Shakira

1.
Fm       Cm   C#             Eb        Fm
You're a song written by the hands of God
               Cm
Don't get me wrong
         C#                  Eb       Fm
'cause this might sound to you a bit odd
         Cm      C#
But you own the place
      Eb                Fm   Cm
where all my thoughts go hiding
     C#                           Eb
And right under your clothes is where I'll find them


Chorus:
Ab    Cm7        C#                 Eb
Underneath your clothes, there's an endless story
Ab           Cm7   C#               Eb
There's the man I chose, there's my territory
    Cm                  Fm
And all the things I deserve
     C#           Eb                 Ab   C#
For being such a good girl, honey

2.
'Cause of you I forgot the smart ways to lie
Because of you 
I'm running out of reasons to cry
When the friends are gone
When the party is over
We will still belong to each other

Chorus

Coda:
  B            B/Ab         Abm
I love you more than all that's on the planet
                            F#
moving, talking, walking, breathing
      E
You know it's true, oh babe it's so funny
    F#
You almost don't believe it

As every voice is hanging from the silence
Lamps are hanging from the ceiling
Like a lady tied to her manners
F#                   Fm
I'm tied up to this feel(ing)

Solo:
[: Fm Cm C# Eb :] (3x)

Chorus 2x
For being such a good girl ...
