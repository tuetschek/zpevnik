Sixteen Tons
Tennessee Ernie Ford

1.
Am                      Dm          E
Some people say a man's made out of mud
      Am                     Dm         E
but a poor man's made out of muscle and blood
Am                Dm
Muscle and blood, skin and bones,
Am                       E           E7
a mind that's weak and a body that's strong

Chorus:
         Am      Am/G     Am/F    E
You load sixteen tons and whaddya get,
 Am          Am/G      Am/F     E
another day older and deeper in debt
      Am                             Dm
Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go,
 Am                  E       Am
I owe my soul to the company store

2.
I was born one morning when the sun didn't shine,
picked up my shovel and walked to the mine
I loaded sixteen tons of number nine coal;
the straw boss said "well, damn my soul."

Chorus

3.
I was born one morning, it was drizzling rain.
Fightin' and trouble are my middle name.
I was raised in a cane break by an old mama lion,
can't no high-toned woman make me walk the line

Chorus

4.
If you see me comin' you better step aside;
another man didn't and another man died.
I've got a fist full of iron and a fist full of steel,
if the left one don't get you, well, the right one will

Chorus
