Come Together
The Beatles 

Dm
Here come old flat top, He come grooving up slowly,
Dm
He got Joo Joo eyeball, He one holy roller 
	A7		
He got  Hair down to his knee;  
G7
Got to be a joker, he just do what he please. 

Dm 			
He wear no shoe shine, he got toe jam football
Dm
He got monkey finger, he shoot co-ca cola
        A7 
He say, "I know you, you know me."  
G7
One thing I can tell you is you got to be free
     Bm              G     A
Come Together, Right now, over me

He bag production, He got wal-rus gumboot
He got O-no sideboard, He one spinal cracker
He got feet down below his knee
Hold you in his armchair, you can feel his disease 
Come together, right now,  over me

He roller coaster, he got early warning
He got muddy water, He one Mo-jo filter
He say, " One and one and one is three."
Got to be good looking 'cause he so hard to see 
Come together, Right now, over me
