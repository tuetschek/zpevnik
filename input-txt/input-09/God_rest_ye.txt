God rest ye merry, gentlemen, 
    A              H
Let nothing you dismay.
Em                  Hm
Remember Christ our Saviour
    A                H
was born on Christmas day.
   C                G
To save us all from Satan's powers
        Hm         D
when we were gone astray.
   G          Hm          Em               D
O, tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy;
   G          Hm      D   Em
O, tidings of comfort and joy.

In Bethlehem, in Israel,
This blessed Babe was born
And laid within a manger
Upon this blessed morn
The which His Mother Mary
Did nothing take in scorn
O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

From God our Heavenly Father
A blessed Angel came;
And unto certain Shepherds
Brought tidings of the same:
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by Name.
O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy
