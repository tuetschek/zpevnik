Danny Boy

                  C                    F
Oh Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling 
                       C                 G
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side 
             C                       F
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling 
                                C      G      C
'Tis you must go, 'tis you must go and I must bide 

        C             F               C
But come ye back when summer's in the meadow 
            Am                  F          G
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow 
             C        F              C     Am 
'Tis I'll be there in sunshine or in shadow 
                       C      G        C
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so 

But if you come, and all the flowers are dying 
If I am dead, as dead I may well be 
You'll come and find the place where I am lying 
And kneel and say an "Ave" there for me 

And I shall hear, tho' soft you tread above me 
And all my grave shall warm and sweeter be 
If you will bend and tell me that you love me 
Then I will sleep in peace until you come to me
