Jim Bridger

1.
Am
Once there was a mountain man who couldn’t write his name,
                                    Dm
yet he deserves a front row seat in history’s hall of fame.
      Am                              Dm
He forgot more about the Indians than we will ever know,
   Am               
he spoke the language of the Sioux - -
    E                 Am
the Blackfoot and the Crow.

R: 
      A                              E
Let’s drink to old Jim Bridger, yes, lift your glasses high,
                                E7             A
as long as there’s a USA, don’t let his memory die.
                                  A7               D
That he was making history, never once occurred to him,
      E                               E7                    Am
but I doubt if we’d a been here, if it weren’t for men like Jim.

He spoke with General Custer and said, “Listen, Yellow Hair,
the Sioux were a great nation, so treat them fair and square.
Sit in on their war council, don’t laugh away their pride,
but Custer didn’t listen, at Little Big Horn Custer died. + CHORUS

There’s poems and there’s legends that tell of Carson’s fame,
yet compared to Jim Bridger, Kit was civilized and tame.
These words are straight from Carson’s lips,  if you place such store by him,
if there’s a man who knows  this gun – forsaken land it’s Jim.
