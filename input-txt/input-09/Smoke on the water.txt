We all came out to montreux
        C      D    Am    
On the lake geneva shoreline
Am 
To make records with a mobile
    C      D        Am
We didn't have much time
Am
Frank zappa and the mothers
     C             D    D
Were at the best place around
Am
But some stupid with a flare gun
C                D      Am
Burned the place to the ground
D             F    Am    C      Am
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky
D             F
Smoke on the water...

2x Riff:

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the grand hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the rolling truck stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky
