intro:

verse:
F#    C#             G#m
Angel came down from heaven yesterday
B                                  F#       E
Stayed with me just long enough to rescue me....
F#      C#        G#m
And she told me a story yesterday
B                                             F#        E
About the sweet love between the moon and the deep blue sea
D                              F#
Then she spread her wings high over me....she said
      G#m   A#m         B
She's gonna come back tomorrow
B
And I said....


chorus:
E               F#m
Fly on my sweet angel.........
C      A           D    D# 
Fly on through the sky.........
E               F#m
Fly on my sweet angel..........
C        A         D  D#      E    C A D D#
Tomorrow I'm gonna be by your side


Sure enough this woman came home to me
Silver wings silhouetted against a child's sunrise
And my Angel she said unto me
Today is the day for you to rise.
Take my hand you're gonna be my man, you're gonna rise
Then she took me high over yonder
And I said..


chorus
