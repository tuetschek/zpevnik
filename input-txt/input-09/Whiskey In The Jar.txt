     G                              Em 
As I was goin' over, the Cork and Kerry mountains 
    C                                        G 
I saw Captain Farrell, and his money he was countin' 
    G                                          Em 
I first produced my pistol, and then produced my rapier 
           C                                    G 
I said stand and deliver, or the devil he may take ya

I took all of his money, and it was a pretty penny 
I took all of his money, and I brought it home to Molly 
She swore that she loved me, never would she leave me 
But the devil take that woman, for you know she tricked me easy  

R:
Musha ring dum a do dum a dah 
Whack for my daddy-o 
Whack for my daddy-o 
There's whiskey in the jar-o  

3.
Being drunk and weary, I went to Molly's chamber 
Takin' my money with me, and I never knew the danger 
For about six or maybe seven, in walked Captain Farrell 
I jumped up, fired off my pistols, and I shot him with both barrels  
 
R:
Musha ring dum a do dum a dah 
Whack for my daddy-o 
Whack for my daddy-o 
There's whiskey in the jar-o

Now some men like the fishin', and some men like the fowlin' 
And some men like ta hear, a cannon ball a roarin' 
But me I like sleepin', specially in my Molly's chamber 
But here I am in prison, here I am with a ball and chain yeah  

R:
Musha ring dum a doo dum a da 
Whack for my daddy-o 
Whack for my daddy-o 
There's whiskey in the jar-o
