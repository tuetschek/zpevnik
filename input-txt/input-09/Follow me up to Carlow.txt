Follow Me up to Carlow

Em                                             D
Lift Mac Cahir Og your face, brooding o'er the old disgrace 
     Em                                                 D      Em
That black Fitzwilliam stormed your place and drove you to the Fern.
Em                                             D
Gray said victory was sure, soon the firebrand he'd secure
  Em                                  D      Em
Until he met at Glenmalure, Fiach Mac Hugh O'Byrne

Chorus:
Bm                             D
Curse and swear, Lord Kildare, Fiach will do what Feach will dare
Bm                           D              Em
Now Fitzwilliam have a care, fallen is your star low
Bm                               D
Up with halbert, out with sword, on we go for by the Lord
Bm                                 D               Em
Fiach Mac Hugh has given his word: Follow me up to Carlow 
 

See the swords of Glen Imayle flashing o'er the English Pale
See all the children of the Gael, beneath O'Byrne's banners
Rooster of the fighting stock, would you let an English cock
Crow out upon an Irish rock, fly up and teach him manners
 

Chorus:

From Tassagart to Clonmore flows a stream of Saxon Gore
Great is Rory Og O'More at sending loons to Hades.
White is sick and Lane is fled, now for black Fitzwilliams head
We'll send it over, dripping red, to Liza and her ladies
 
Chorus:
