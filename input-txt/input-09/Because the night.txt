Bruce Springsteen and Patti Smith

Intro: 
Bm G A Bm G A Bm

Verse:

Bm      G          A         Bm
Take me now, baby, here as I am.
        G             A    Bm
Pull me close try and understand.
          G              A      Bm
Desire is hunger, is the fire I breathe.
          G          A        Bm
Love is a banquet on which we feed.
Bb       G           D    A
Come on now, try and understand
    Bm    G             D       A
the way I feel when I'm in your hand.
Bb       G         D     A
Take my hand; come under cover.
     C                   Bm                  F#
They can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now.


Chorus:

Bm          G       D        A
Because the night belongs to lovers.
Bm          G       A        Bm
Because the night belongs to lust.
Bm          G       D        A
Because the night belongs to lovers.
Bm          G       A        Bm
Because the night belongs to us.


Verse:

Have I doubt when I'm alone?
Love is a ring on the telephone.
Love is an angel disguised as lust,
here in our bed until the morning comes.
Come on now, try and understand
the way I feel under your command.
Take my hand as the sun descends.
They can't touch you now, can't touch you now, can't touch you now.

Repeat chorus

Ending:

     D       A           D         A               Bm        A
With love we sleep; with doubt the viscious circle turns and burns.
    D        A           Bm       A        D         A
Without you, oh I cannot live, forgive the yearning, burning
    G          D         G       G
I believe it's time, too real to feel,
   Bm       G    D        Bm   G            F#
so touch me now, touch me now, touch me --- now.


Repeat chorus and fade.
