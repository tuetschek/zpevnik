The Last Unicorn
America

         Am                        F              G
When the last eagle flies over the last crumbling mountain
        Am                     F          G
And the last lion roars at the last dusty fountain
       Am            Em                 F              C
In the shadow of the forest, though she may be old and worn
          F       C
They will stare unbelieving
At the [F]last uni[G]corn [n.c.]

When the first breath of winter through the flowers is icing
And you look to the north and a pale moon is rising
And it seems like all is dying and would leave the world to mourn
In the distance hear her laughter
Of the last unicorn

     C Am             G   Am  Em   F   G
I'm alive--------I'm alive

When the last moon is cast over the last star of morning
And  the future is past without even a last desperate warning
Then look into the sky where through the clouds a path is formed
Look and see her how she sparkles
It's the last unicorn

     C    Am          G   C  Am7            G   Am   Em    F    G
I'm alive--------I'm alive--------------I'm alive

Am   Em   F   G
