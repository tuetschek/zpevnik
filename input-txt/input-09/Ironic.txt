Ironic
Alanis Morissette

G   C   G             Am   
An old man turned ninety-eight
           G    C      G              Am
he won the lottery and died the next day.

It's a black fly in your chardonnay,

it's a death row pardon two minutes to late.

Isn't it ironic... don't you think?
			
          G    C      G              Am
It's like rain on your wedding day,
                     
it's a free ride when you've already paid,
                      
it's the good advice that you just didn't take,
Bb               F           G 
who would have thought... it figures.
			

Mr. play-it-safe was afraid to fly,
he packed his suitcase and kissed his kids good-bye.
He waited his whole damn life just to take that flight
and as the plane crashed down he thought "well isn't this nice...".
And isn't it ironic... don't you think?

     F                                G 
Well life has a funny way of sneaking up on you,
     F                                G 
when you think everything is okay and everything's going right.
     F                                G 
And life has a funny way of helping you out when
     F
you think everything's gone wrong and everything blows up in your face.


A traffic jam when you are already late,
a no-smoking sign on your cigarette break.
It's like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife,
it's like meeting the man of my dreams then meeting his beautiful wife.
And isn't it ironic... don't you think?

a little too ironic... and yeah i really do think...


 C                                    G
Life has a funny way of sneaking up on you,
 C                                   G           C
life has a funny, funny way  of helping you out -- helping you out.
