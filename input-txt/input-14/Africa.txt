Intro (4x)

1.
A                E/C#    F#m
I hear the drums echoing tonight
    E              G/D              D/E         A     G  F#  B 
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
A           E/C#     F#m
Shes coming in 12:30 flight
    E               G/D                  D/E                 A     G  F#  B 
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
A            E/C#              F#m
I stopped an old man along the way
E                   G/D            D/E              A       G  F#  B 
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
A            E/C#        F#m                  G                      F#  B 
He turned to me as if to say, "Hurry boy, its waiting there for you!"

Em                C               G        D   
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
Em                     C              G               D
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
Em          C             G   D
I bless the rains down in Africa
Em              C              G               Bm7   D   Em F#m 
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

Bridge (2x)
G  F#  B

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
Sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

Solo:

A  E/C#  F#m 
                G                    F#  B 
Hurry boy, shes waiting there for you

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa (5x)
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had
