1.
Dsus2            Dsus2/G                  Asus4 A Asus2 A 
  Where is the moment when we need it the most 
Dsus2            Dsus2/G                  Asus4 A Asus2 A 
  You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
Bm                  Bm/A                G 
  They tell me your blue sky's faded to grey
                 Dadd9/F#        Em7 
The tell me your passion's gone away
                             A Asus2 A  
And I don't need no carrying on 

Dsus2          Dsus2/G                A   Asus2 A 
  Stand in the line just ahead of the law
Dsus2             Dsus2/G                   A Asus2 A 
  You're faking a smile with the coffee you go 
Bm                  Bm/A                G 
  You tell me your life's been way off line 
                  Dadd9/F#    Em7 
You're falling to pieces everytime 
                             A 
And I don't need no carrying on 


Chorus: 
                    Dsus2                   Dsus2/G 
Cause you had a bad day,  you're taking one down 
               Em7                   A
You sing a sad song just to turn it around 
                  Dsus2                   Dsus2/G
You say you don't know, you tell me don't lie
              Em7                    A 
You work at a smile and you go for a ride 
              Bm                    Bm/A 
You had a bad day, the camera don't lie
                   G                         Dadd9/F#
You're coming back down and you really don't mind 
              Em7  A
You had a bad day,  you had a bad day.

Bm                  Bm/A         G 
Well you need a blue sky holiday
                   Dadd9/F#        Em7 
The point is they laugh at what you say 
                             Asus4  A 
And I don't need no carrying on 


Chorus 

Bridge:
F               
Sometimes the system goes on the blink
        Bb
And the whole thing it turns out wrong 
    F
You might not make it back and you know 
               Bb
That you could be well oh that strong 
             Asus4 A Asus2 A   
Well I'm not wrong 

Dsus2           Dsus2/G                           A
So where is the passion when you need it the most (Oh you and I)
Dsus2               Dsus2/G                  A
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost 

Chorus
