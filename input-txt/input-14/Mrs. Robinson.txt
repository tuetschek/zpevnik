E7
We'd like to know a little bit about you for our files
A
We'd like to help you learn to help yourself
D               G               C           Am
Look around you all you see are sympathetic eyes
E7                          D
Stroll around the grounds until you feel at home


R:

Hide it in a hiding place where no one ever goes
Put it in your pantry with your cupcakes
It's a little secret just the Robinsons' afair
Most of all you've got to hide it from the kids


R:
Koo koo ka choo Mrs. Robinson...

Sitting on a sofa on a Sunday afternoon
Going to the candidates debate
Laugh about it shout about it when you've got to choose
Any way you look at it you lose

R:
Where have you gone Joe DiMaggio
A nation turns its lonely eyes to you, woo woo woo
What's that you say Mrs. Robinson
Joltin' Joe has left and gone away, hey hey hey, hey hey hey
