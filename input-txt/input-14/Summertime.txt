Summertime
George Gershwin


      F#m7 G#m7b5   C#7       F#m7 F#7
Summertime, and the living is easy, 
         Bm                        G#m7b5  C#7
Fish are jumping and the cotton is high. 
              F#m7 Gm7b5     C#7          F#m     Bm
Your daddy is rich  and your mummy's good lookin', 
E7 Amaj7             G#m7b5 C#7 F#m7  G#m7b5 C#7
So hush, little baby, don't you cry. 

One of these mornings you'll gonna rise up singin', 
Then you'll spread your wings and you'll take the sky.
But till that morning there's nothing can harm you, 
With daddy and mammy, mammy standing by.
