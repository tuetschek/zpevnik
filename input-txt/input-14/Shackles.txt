Shackles (Praise You)
Mary Mary

Gm  Cm  D  Gm

Chorus:
         Gm                            Cm
Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance
             D                       Gm
I just wanna praise you I just wanna praise you
    Gm                                 Cm
You broke the chains now I can lift my hands
               D                    Gm
And I'm gonna praise you, I'm gonna praise you


1.
       Gm    
In the corners of mind, 
             Cm
I just can't seem to find
              D
a reason to believe 
           Gm
that I can break free
                           Gm
Cause you see, I have been down for so long
              Cm              
Feel like the hope is gone
                 D
But as I lift my hands, I understand
              Gm
That I should praise you through my circumstance


Chorus

2.
Everything that could go wrong
All went wrong at one time
So much pressure fell on me
I thought I was gonna lose my mind
But I know you wanna see
If I will hold on through these trials
But I need you to lift this load
Cause I can't take it anymore


Chorus


Bridge:
     Gm
Been through the fire and the rain
Cm
Bound in every kind of way
     D
But God has broken every chain
    Gm
So let me go right now


Chorus 3x
