No Diggity/Thrift Shop
Ed Sheeran & Passenger

Intro:
           F#m
Shorty get down, good Lord
E                    D              
Baby got 'em up open all over town
F#m              
   Strictly biz, she don't play around
           E           D              
Cover much ground, got game by the pound
F#m              
   Getting paid is a forte
         E               D              
Each and every day, true player way
  F#m              
I can't get her out of my mind (say what)
  E                            D              
I think about the girl all the time (well, well)

1.
F#m
East side to the west side
        E                D
Pushing phat rides, aint no surprise
F#m
She got tricks in the stash
                E
Stacking up the cash
              D
Quick when it comes to the gas

F#m
By no means average
     E                    D
It's on when she's got to have it
F#m                                     E              
Baby, you're a perfect ten, I wanna get in
            D
Let me come in, so I can win


Chorus (3x):
F#m
I like the way you work it 
   E                 D
No diggity, I got to bag it up, (bag it up now)

2.
She's got class and style
And balance by the pound,
Shorty never act wild
Very low key on the profile
Catching villains is a no,
Let me tell you how it goes
Curves the words, spins the verbs
Lovers it curves so freak what you heard

Rollin' with the phatness
You never quite know what the half is
You got to pay to play
Just for shorty, bang-bang, to look your way

I like the way you work it
Tough notch, Trumped tight, every day,
You're blowing my mind, baby, in time
maybe I can get you in my ride

Chorus:

Bridge:
F#m
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo
E          D
 Damn that girl looks good
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo
Play on, play on, play on
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo
Damn that girl looks good
F#m                          E    D
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo no no 

3.
       F#m 
'Cause I'm gonna pop some tags
         E                    D
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
F#m
I - I - I'm huntin', lookin' for a come-up
E                 D
This is freaking awesome
    F#m 
Now I'm gonna pop some tags...


Outro (4x):
F#m
I'm gonna pop some tags (I like the way you work it)
      E               D
No diggity, I got to bag it up (bag it up now)
