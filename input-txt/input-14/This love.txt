Maroon 5

G Cm Fm G7

1.
G                       Cm
I was so high I did not recognize
                 Fm
The fire burning in her eyes
               G7
The chaos that controlled my mind
G                            Cm
whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
           Fm
Never to return again
                 G7
But always in my heart


Chorus:
 Cm  Fm       Bb        Eb
This love has taken its toll on me
 Cm          Fm      Bb           Eb
She said Goodbye too many times before
    Cm  Fm       Bb          Eb
And her heart is breaking in front of me
 Cm       Fm           Bb              Ab     G
I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore

Cm Fm G7


Verse 2:
I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again  (oh!)

Chorus

Bridge
Fm
I'll fix these broken things
Ebmaj7
Repair your broken wings
G7                          Cm
And make sure everything's alright (it's alright)
Fm
My pressure on her hips
Ebmaj7
Sinking my fingertips
G
Into every inch of you
G7
Cause I know that's what you want me to do

Chorus 3x
