Once  there was this kid who
F           C            G#               C
got into an accident and couldn't come to school,
    F               G    C
But when he finally came back,
G   C    F               C     G
his hair had turned from black into bright white.
   G#               C        
He said that it was from when
    G#               Cmaj7addF F
the cars had smashed soooo     hard

2.
Once there was this girl who
wouldn't go to change with the girls in the change room,
But when they finally made her
they saw birthmarks all over her body.
She couldn't quite explain it,
they'd always just been there...

Chorus 2x

Bridge:
Dm            C    G
Both girl and boy were glad
Dm             C     G        F G
One kid had it worse than that

3.
Cause then there was a boy whose
parents made him come right home directly after school,
And when they went to their church,
they shook and lurched all over the church floor.
He couldn't quite explain it,
they'd always just gone there...

Chorus 2x

Outro (2x):
Dm Dm C G Dm Dm C G F G F G
