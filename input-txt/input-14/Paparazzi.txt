I'll be a girl backstage at your show
velvet ropes and guitars, yeah cause you're my rockstar
In between the sets, eyeliner and cigarettes

Shadow is burnt, yellow dance and return
My lashes are dry, but the teardrops I cry
         C                           Bm
It don't have a price, loving you is cherry pie

'Cause you know that baby I

Chorus 2x
