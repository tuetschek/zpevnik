Intro: 
A Bm D A (2x)

A
Twenty-five years and my life is still,
Bm                                      D
trying to get up that great big hill of hope
           A
for a destination.

I realized quickly when I knew I should
that the whole world's made up of this brotherhood of men,
for whatever that means.

Pre-Chorus:
And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
just to get it all out, what's in my head,
and I, I am feelin' a little peculiar.

And so I wake in the mornin' and I step outside,
and I take a deep breath and I get real high,
and I scream from the top of my lungs:
A
What's goin' on?

Chorus: (2x)
          A               Bm
And I say hey-ey-ey-ey-eh hey-ey-eh
       D                 A
I said hey, what's goin' on?

Ooh, Ooh, Oooohh, Oooohh...
Ooh, Ooh, Oooohh, Oooohh...

And I try, oh my God, do I try,
I try all the time in this institution.
And I pray, oh my God, do I pray,
I pray ev'ry single day for a revolution.

Pre-Chorus

Chorus 2x

Ooh, Ooh, Oooohh, Oooohh...

Twenty-five years and my life is still,
trying to get up that great big hill of hope
for a destination.
