Counting Stars
One Republic

R:
Am                 C
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
G                              F
Dreaming about the things that we could be
    Am               C
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard,
G                   
Said, no more counting dollars
F                              F
We'll be counting stars, yeah we'll be counting stars


           Am
I see this life like a swinging vine
C
Swing my heart across the line
G
In my face is flashing signs
F
Seek it out and ye shall find
Am
Oh, but I'm not that old
C
Young, but I'm not that bold
G
I don't think the world is sold
F
I'm just doing what we're told

Am C                G
I feel something so right
          F
Doing the wrong thing
Am C                G
I feel something so wrong
          F
Doing the right thing
F
I could lie, could lie, could lie
F (1 strum)
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive


R. 2x

I feel the love and I feel it burn
Down this river, every turn
Hope is a four-letter word
Make that money, watch it burn
Oh, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
I don't think the world is sold
I'm just doing what we're told
  I feel something so wrong
Doing the right thing
I could lie, could lie, could lie
Everything that drowns me makes me wanna fly

The lessons are learned..
