1.
She confessed her love to me, then she vanished on the breeze,
trying to hold on to that was just impossible.
She was more than beautiful, closer to ethereal
with a kind of down to earth flavor.

Am
Close my eyes, it's three in the afternoon
                                          Em
then I realize that she's really gone for good

Chorus 1:
         C   D  Hm Em         C    D    Em
Anybody seen my baby, anybody seen her around?
                  C       D
Love has gone and made me blind,
        Hm                   Em
I've looked but i just can't find.
               C    D      Em
She has gotten lost in the crowd.

2.
I was flippin' magazines, in the place of Mercer street
when I thought I spotted her.
Getting on a motorbike, looking rather ladylike
didn't she just give me a wave?

Salty tears, it's three in the afternoon,
has she disappeared, is she really gone for good?

Chorus 2:
Anybody seen my baby, anybody seen her around?
If I just-just close my eyes, 
I reach out and touch the prize.
Anybody seen her around?

Rap solo

Chorus 2 2x

Outro:
Lost, lost and never found, 
I must have called her a thousand times.
Something I think she's just in my imagination, 
lost in the crowd...
