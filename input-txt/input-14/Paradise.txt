Intro: 
Bb C Dm F 3x 
Bb F C 2x
Gm Bb F C 4x

1.
Gm                  F
When she was just a girl
Dm               C
She expected the world
        Gm                 F
But it flew away from her reach
        Dm              C
So she ran away in her sleep

Chorus:
                Gm        Bb
And dreamed of para-para-paradise
F        C
Para-para-paradise
Gm         Bb
Para-para-paradise
C              F
Every time she closed her eyes

Gm F Dm C 2x

2.
When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
And the bullets catch in her teeth

Bridge:
Bb               F 
Life goes on, it gets so heavy
    F                C
The wheel breaks the butterfly
Bb            F
Every tear, a waterfall
        Bb              F                     C
In the night the stormy night, she closed her eyes
        Bb              F                 C
In the night the stormy night, away she'd fly

Chorus (2x):
And dream of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Whoa-oh-oh oh-oooh oh-oh-oh

Bb C Dm F 3x

    Bb        F                  C
So lying underneath those stormy skies
         Bb               F        C
She said oh-oh-oh-oh-oh I know the sun must set to rise

Chorus (2x):
This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
This could be para-para-paradise
Whoa-oh-oh oh-oooh oh-oh-oh

Gm Bb F C 2x

Chorus

Bb C C Dm B B Dm
