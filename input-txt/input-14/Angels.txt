Angels
Robbie Williams

1.
E           E                         A             C#m    
  I sit and wait. Does an angel contemplate my fate.
B            E                                             A   C#m        
And do they know the places were we go when we're grey and old.
B               A                              C#m           A
Cuz I have been told that salvation lets their wings unfold.
            D                         A
So when I'm lying in my bed, thoughts running through my head,
      E                      D           A        E    
And I feel that love is dead. I'm loving angels instead.

Chorus:
               B                    C#m
And through it all she offers me protection, 
                A                              E
A lot love and affection, whether I'm right or wrong.
                  B                    C#m
And down the waterfall wherever it may take me,
                       A
I know that life won't break me.
               G#m                F#m
When I come to call, she won't forsake me.
D           A        E
 I'm loving angels instead.

2.
When I'm feeling weak and my pain walks down a one way street.
I look above and I know I'll always be blessed with love.
And as the feeling grows, she breathes flesh to my bones
And when love is dead, I'm loving angels instead.
