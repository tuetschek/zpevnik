Do You Believe In Magic
The Lovin' Spoonful

G                 C          F
Do you believe in magic in a young girl's heart
        C                       F
How the music can free her, whenever it starts
         C             F
And it's magic, if the music is groovy
   C                            F
It makes you feel happy like an old-time movie
     Dm                 Em               F         Em
I'll tell you about the magic, and it'll free your soul
              G
But it's like trying to tell a stranger 'bout rock and roll

If you believe in magic don't bother to choose
If it's jug band music or rhythm and blues
Just go and listen it'll start with a smile
It won't wipe off your face no matter how hard you try
Your feet start tapping and you can't seem to find
How you got there, so just blow your mind

If you believe in magic, come along with me
We'll dance until morning 'til there's just you and me
And maybe, if the music is right
I'll meet you tomorrow, sort of late at night
And we'll go dancing, baby, then you'll see
How the magic's in the music and the music's in me

                        C
Yeah, do you believe in magic
      F              Em         F            Em
Yeah, believe in the magic of a young girl's soul
  F            Em       F        Em
Believe in the magic of rock and roll
  F            Em             F       Em
Believe in the magic that can set you free
                   F
Ohh, talking 'bout magic

      C     Dm         Em   Dm
