Homeward Bound
Simon & Garfunkel

    A
I'm sitting in the railway station.
      Amaj7                  A7    F#
Got a ticket for my destination, mmmm
Bm                               G
On a tour of one-night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand.
    A                                  E7               A
And ev'ry stop is neatly planned for a poet and one-man band.


Chorus:
         D            A
Homeward bound,  wish I was,
         D
Homeward bound,
A             Asus4
Home where my thought's escaping
A             Asus4
Home where my music's playing,
A             Asus4
Home where my love lays waiting
E           A
Silently for me.


Ev'ry day's an endless stream
Of cigarettes and magazines, mmmm
And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories
And ev'ry stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be,


Chorus

Tonight I'll sing my songs again,
I'll play the game and pretend, mmmm
But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity
Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me.

Chorus
Amaj7       A7       A
  Silently for me.
