1.
G           D    
 My name is Luka, 
C               D    
 I live on the second floor
G         D    
 I live upstairs from you
C                   D    
 Yes I think you've seen me before
Em7          D                 Em7
 If you hear something late at night
             D                     C    
Some kind of trouble, some kind of fight
           D                 C    
Just don't ask me what it was
           D                 C    
Just don't ask me what it was
           D                 G
Just don't ask me what it was

2.
I think it's because I'm clumsy
I try not to talk too loud
Maybe it's because I'm crazy
I try not to act too proud
They only hit you until you cry
And after that you don't ask why
You just don't argue anymore
You just don't argue anymore
You just don't argue anymore

3.
Yes I think I'm OK
I walked into the door again
Well, if you ask that's what I'll say
And it's not your business anyway
I guess I'd like to be alone
With nothing broken, nothing thrown
Just don't ask me how I am
Just don't ask me how I am
Just don't ask me how I am

4. = 1.

And they only hit until you cry
And after that you don't ask why
You just don't argue anymore
You just don't argue anymore
You just don't argue anymore
