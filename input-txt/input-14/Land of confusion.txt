Land of Confusion
Genesis

1.
D E
  I must have dreamed a thousand dreams,
G A
  been hunted by a million screams.
A G
  I can hear the marching feet,
D E
  they're moving into the street.

2.
Now did you read the news today ?
They say the danger's gone away.
But I can see the fire's still alight
burning into the night.

Chorus:
D                E    G        A
There's too many men, too many people
       D        E
making too many problems,
    D        E
and not much love to go around.
A                        G           E
Can't you see, this is a land of confusion ?
E  C           D        Bm        E
So this is the world we live in,
C                 D           Bm      E
and these are the hands we're given.
C            D           Bm      E
Use them and let's start trying
C            D           Bm     A
to make it a place worth living in.

3.
Oh superman, where are you now,
when everything's gone wrong somehow ?
The man of steel, men of power
are losing control by the hour.


Chorus:
This is the time, this is the place.
So we look for the future.
But there's not much love to go around...

C#m   F#/C#   A/C#   C#m F#/C#

           C#m                F#/C# 
I remember long ago, when the sun was shining,
    A/C#         
the stars were bright all through the night,
        C#m
and the sound of your laughter
              A/C#           C   D C D C D C D
as I held you tight, so long ago.

4.
I won't be coming home tonight.
My generation will put it right.
We're not just making promises
that we know we'll never keep.


Chorus:
Too many men, too many people...

This is a world we live in
and these are the names we're given.
Stand up and let's start showing
C              D         Bm    E   D E
just where our lives are going to
