1.
G         C   Am          G
  I see a home in a quiet place
        C   Am             G
I see myself in a strong embrace
              C      Am                G
And I feel protection from the human race
           C      Am 
It's not parental

           Cmaj7 D    Em      Gmaj7   Cmaj7 D    Em
But it's a fan – ta – sy, not a     rea –   li – ty
    Gmaj7   Cmaj7     D           Em  Gmaj7    Cmaj7  D   Asus2
And it's no good, no, no good for me, you have no     i – dea

Chorus:
                             Em
That I'm walking through the clouds
            Emadd9        Cmaj7
When you're looking at me
    Gmaj7          Em
I'm feeling like a child
       Emadd9  Cmaj7
Vulnerabili –  ty
     Gmaj7          Em          Emadd9        Cmaj7
I am shaking like a leaf if you move beside me
           Gmaj7         Em
And you're all that I see
         Emaad9        D Em
But it's no good for me

2.
You have a home, (you have a home) in a quiet place
And someone else, feels your strong embrace
She is protected and she needs no chase
And do you love her

You're a mystery, you are the heart of intrigue
You're no good no, no good for me, that you have no idea


Chorus:

Solo: 
Em  Emadd9 Cmaj7  Gmaj7 (3x)
Em  Emadd9 D  Em

     Gmaj7  Cmaj7   D   Em     Gmaj7    Cmaj7  D   Asus2
It's a      ma – ke-be– lieve, you have no     i – dea

Chorus:
That I'm walking... and you're all that I see
         Emadd9        Cmaj7       Gmaj7
But it's no good, just no good, no good
            Em
Through the clouds when you're looking at me...
...and you're all that I see
         Emaad9               D           Em
But it's no good for me, it's no good for me
