I made you believe we're more than just friends (Oh baby)
C#m      G#          C#m
It might seem like a crush
              A                 G#
But it doesnt mean that I'm serious
          A           G#
'cause to lose all my senses
         A                B
That is just so typically me
Oh baby, baby

Oops! I did it again
  B                E          B           A
I played with your heart, got lost in the game
   G#
Oh baby, baby
C#m       G#           C#m
Oops! You think I'm in love
         B          E

   G#
Im not that innocent

2:
You see my problem is this
I'm dreaming away, wishing that heroes, they truly exist
I cry, watching the days
Can't you see I'm a fool in so many ways
'cause to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me

Britney, before you go, theres something I want you to have
Oh, its beautiful, but wait a minute, isn't this...?

Yeah, yes it is
                                                B
But I thought the old lady dropped it into the ocean in the end

Well baby, I went down and got it for you.
Oh, you shouldn't have
