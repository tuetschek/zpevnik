Eternal Flame
Bangles

1.
G          Em    C            D        
Close your eyes, give me your hand, darling 
G      Em            C        D           Em
Do you feel my heart beating, do you understand 
       Bm       Em    A         D   Bm
Do you feel the same, am I only dreaming?
Asus2           C
Is this burning an eternal flame?

2.
I believe it's meant to-o be, darling
I watch you when you are sleeping, you belong with me
Do you feel the same, am I only dreaming?
   C                                
Or is this burning an eternal flame?

Bridge:
D      Asus2  Em
Say my name,  sun shines through the rain 
        F       G
A whole life so lonely 
             C        G        C
And then you come and ease the pain 
D                         F   C    Dsus2
I don't want to lose this feeling, o-oh
