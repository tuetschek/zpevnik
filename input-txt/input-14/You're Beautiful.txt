You're Beautiful
James Blunt

1.
C                     C/B
 My life is brilliant, my love is pure
Am7             F9
 I saw an angel, of that I'm sure
    C                                   C/B
She smiled at me on the subway, she was with another man
    Am7                                  F9
But I won't lose no sleep on that 'cause I've got a plan

Chorus:
F9            G   Am7           G
 You're beautiful, you're beautiful
F9            G         C
 You're beautiful, it's true
  F9       G         C   G   Am7
I saw your face in a crowded place
      F9         G       Am7
And I don't know what to do
            F9    G       C   C/B Am7 F9
'Cause I'll never be with you

2.
Yes, she caught my eye, as we walked on by
She could see from my face that I was fuckin' high
And I don't think that I'll see her again
But we shared a moment that will last till the end

Chorus

F9         Am7         F9           G    F9 G
La-la-la-la La-la-la-la La-la-la-la La-a

Chorus:
You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
There must be an angel with a smile on her face
         F9                       G            C G Am7
When she thought up that I should be with you.
         F9      G        Am7
But it's time to face the truth,
       F9    G       C
I will never be with you.
