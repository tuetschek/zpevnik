It Never Rains In Southern California

1.
G      Am                D           G
Got on board a westbound seven forty seven
       Am             D              G
Didn't think before deciding what to do
         Am           D         G             Em
All that talk of opportunities, TV breaks and movies
     Am   D          G
Rang true, sure rang true.

R:
         Am            D            G     Em
Seems it never rain in Southern California
           Am               D              G   Em
Seems I've often heard that kind of talk before
         Am           D
It never rains in California
    G                 Em
But girls, don't they warn ya
   Am   D       G
It pours man it pours.

Bridge:
       Am                  D
Out of work, I'm out of my head
               G
Out of self respect I'm out of bread
          Am              D
I'm under loved I'm under fed
           G
I wanna go home
         Am           D
It never rains in California
    G                 Em
But girls, don't they warn ya
   Am   D       G
It pours man it pours.

Will you tell the folks back home I nearly made it
Had offers but don't know which one to take
Please don't tell them how you found me, don't tell them how you found me 
Give me a break, mamma give me a break

         Am            D            G    Em
Seems it never rain in Southern California
           Am               D              G   Em
Seems I've often heard that kind of talk before
         Am           D
It never rains in California
    G                 Em
But girls, don't they warn ya
   Am   D       G
It pours man it pours.
