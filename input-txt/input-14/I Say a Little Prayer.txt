Intro: Piano(F#m D E A  D C#)

1.
F#m                D
The moment I wake up
             E        A
Before I put on my makeup
   D                      C#
I say a little prayer for you
F#m              D 
While combing my hair, now,
                     E       A
And wondering what dress to wear, now,
   D                  C#
I say a little prayer for you

Chorus:
D           E            E          F#m
Forever and ever, you'll stay in my heart
            E
and I will love you
Forever, forever, we never will part
Oh, how I'll love you
Together, together, that's how it must be
To live without you
D            E            C#
Would only be heartbreak for me.

2.
I run for the bus, dear,
While riding I think of us, dear,
I say a little prayer for you.
At work I just take time
And all through my coffee break-time,
I say a little prayer for you.

Chorus 2x

Bridge:
F#m            D
My darling believe me,
          E           
For me there is no one
A
But you, please love me true, I'm in love with you
A
Answer my prayer, say you love me true.
This is my prayer, baby...

Chorus 

Bridge
